# Tao Te Ching (Dao De Jing) - Complete Translation

## Chapter 1

道可道非常道
The Dao that can be spoken of is not the ever-constant Dao.

名可名非常名
The name that can be named is not the ever-constant name.

无名天地之始
That which is without-name is the beginning of heaven and earth.

有名万物之母
That which possesses a name is the mother of the ten thousand creatures.

故常无欲以观其妙
Therefore: always without-desire, thus you observe its subtle mystery.

常有欲以观其徼
Always possessing desires, thus you observe its external appearances.

此两者同出而异名
These two, they arise from the same source but have different names;

同谓之玄
This sameness is called their deep mystery.

玄之又玄
Deep mysteries, and again deep mysteries –

众妙之门
The gateway of many subtle mysteries.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.
The unnamable is the eternally real.
Naming is the origin of all particular things.
Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.
Yet mystery and manifestations arise from the same source.
This source is called darkness.
Darkness within darkness.
The gateway to all understanding.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Existence is beyond the power of words to define:
Terms may be used but are none of them absolute.
In the beginning of heaven and earth there were no words,
Words came out of the womb of matter;
And whether a man dispassionately sees to the core of life
Or passionately sees the surface,
The core and the surface are essentially the same,
Words making them seem different only to express appearance.
If name be needed, wonder names them both:
From wonder into wonder existence opens.

## Chapter 2

天下皆知美之为美斯恶已
In the world, when all know that the action of beauty is beautiful, then ugliness ensues.

皆知善之为善斯不善已
When all know that the action of good is goodness, then not-good ensues.

故有无相生
Therefore: being and non-being create each other,

难易相成
Difficult and easy complete each other,

长短相较
Long and short contrast each other,

高下相倾
High and low lean on each other,

音声相和
Tone and voice harmonize each other,

前后相随
Before and after follow each other.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

处无为之事
Lives by using non-action in his duties,

行不言之教
And practicing no-talking in his teachings.

万物作而不始
The ten thousand creatures arise, but do not have a beginning.

生而不有
Creating but not possessing;

为而不恃
Acting, but not concerned with the results;

功成而弗居
Accomplishing tasks, but not dwelling on them.

夫唯弗居
Now: only because there is no dwelling,

是以不去
Thus the results do not depart.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
When people see some things as beautiful, other things become ugly.
When people see some things as good, other things become bad.
Being and non-being create each other.
Difficult and easy support each other.
Long and short define each other.
High and low depend on each other.
Before and after follow each other.
Therefore the Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything.
Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go.
She has but doesn't possess, acts but doesn't expect.
When her work is done, she forgets it.
That is why it lasts forever.

### Witter Bynner Translation
People through finding something beautiful think something else unbeautiful,
Through finding one man fit judge another unfit.
Life and death, though stemming from each other, seem to conflict as stages of change,
Difficult and easy as phases of achievement,
Long and short as measures of contrast,
High and low as degrees of relation;
But, since the varying of tones gives music to a voice
And what is the was of what shall be,
The sanest man sets up no deed,
Lays down no law,
Takes everything that happens as it comes,
As something to animate, not to appropriate,
To earn, not to own,
To accept naturally without self-importance:
If you never assume importance you never lose it.

## Chapter 3

不尚贤
Not honoring those who are esteemable

使民不争
Ensures that the citizens do not strive.

不贵难得之货
Not valuing rare goods

使民不为盗
Ensures that the citizens do not act like thieves.

不见可欲
Not showing that which can be desired

使民心不乱
Ensures that the citizens' heart/minds do not become confused.

是以圣人之治
Thus the governing of the sage

虚其心实其腹
Empties their heart/minds, fills their stomachs,

弱其志强其骨
Weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.

常使民无知无欲
By always ensuring that the citizens are without-knowledge and without-desire,

使夫智者不敢为
Those who make men wise will not dare to act.

为无为则无不治
Act with non-action, then all will be governed!

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
If you overesteem great men, people become powerless.
If you overvalue possessions, people begin to steal.
The Master leads by emptying people's minds and filling their cores, by weakening their ambition and toughening their resolve.
He helps people lose everything they know, everything they desire, and creates confusion in those who think that they know.
Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place.

### Witter Bynner Translation
It is better not to make merit a matter of reward lest people conspire and contend,
Not to pile up rich belongings lest they rob,
Not to excite by display lest they covet.
A sound leader's aim is to open people's hearts,
Fill their stomachs,
Calm their wills,
Brace their bones
And so to clarify their thoughts and cleanse their needs
That no cunning meddler could touch them:
Without being forced, without strain or constraint,
Good government comes of itself.

## Chapter 4

道冲而用之有不盈
Dao is like a cup or bowl, yet use it and there exists no need to fill it.

渊兮似万物之宗
Profound and deep!, it appears to be the ancestor of the ten thousand creatures.

挫其锐
It blunts their sharpness,

解其纷
Loosens their tangles,

和其光
Softens their brightness,

同其尘
Makes them the same as the dust of the world.

湛兮似或存
Deep and profound!, it seems to barely exist.

吾不知谁之子
I do not know whose child it is –

象帝之先
Its image came before that of god.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao is like a well: used but never used up.
It is like the eternal void: filled with infinite possibilities.
It is hidden but always present.
I don't know who gave birth to it.
It is older than God.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Existence, by nothing bred, breeds everything.
Parent of the universe,
It smooths rough edges,
Unties hard knots,
Tempers the sharp sun,
Lays blowing dust,
Its image in the wellspring never fails.
But how was it conceived?--this image of no other sire.

## Chapter 5

天地不仁
Heaven and earth are not kind –

以万物为刍狗
Thus the ten thousand creatures become as straw dogs to them.

圣人不仁
The sage is not kind –

以百姓为刍狗
Thus the 100 families become as straw dogs to him.

天地之间
The space between heaven and earth,

其犹橐籥乎
How is it just like a bellows or flute?

虚而不屈
It is empty, yet does not run out.

动而愈出
The more it moves, and the more it produces.

多言数穷
Too much talking is exceptionally exhausting,

不如守中
Which is not as good as maintaining what is within.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao doesn't take sides; it gives birth to both good and evil.
The Master doesn't take sides; she welcomes both saints and sinners.
The Tao is like a bellows: it is empty yet infinitely capable.
The more you use it, the more it produces; the more you talk of it, the less you understand.
Hold on to the center.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Nature, immune as to a sacrifice of straw dogs, faces the decay of its fruits.
A sound man, immune as to a sacrifice of straw dogs, faces the passing of human generations.
The universe, like a bellows, is always emptying, always full:
The more it yields, the more it holds.
Men came to their wit's end arguing about it and had better meet it at the marrow.

## Chapter 6

谷神不死
The spirit of the valley does not die –

是谓玄牝
It is called the deep and mysterious feminine.

玄牝之门
The gateway of this deep and mysterious feminine –

是谓天地根
It is called the source of heaven and earth.

绵绵若存
Unbroken, it seems to exist.

用之不勤
Using it takes no effort.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao is called the Great Mother: empty yet inexhaustible, it gives birth to infinite worlds.
It is always present within you.
You can use it any way you want.

### Witter Bynner Translation
The breath of life moves through a deathless valley of mysterious motherhood
Which conceives and bears the universal seed,
The seeming of a world never to end,
Breath for men to draw from as they will:
And the more they take of it, the more remains.

## Chapter 7

天长地久
Heaven is eternal, earth is enduring.

天地所以能长且久者
The reason that heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring

以其不自生
Is because they do not live for themselves.

故能长生
Therefore they can live forever.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

后其身而身先
Puts his self behind others, yet finds his self before them.

外其身而身存
Considers his self extraneous, yet his self survives.

非以其无私邪
Is this not because he has no self-interests?

故能成其私
Therefore he can achieve his self-interests.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao is infinite, eternal.
Why is it eternal?
It was never born; thus it can never die.
Why is it infinite?
It has no desires for itself; thus it is present for all beings.
The Master stays behind; that is why she is ahead.
She is detached from all things; that is why she is one with them.
Because she has let go of herself, she is perfectly fulfilled.

### Witter Bynner Translation
The universe is deathless, is deathless because, having no finite self, it stays infinite.
A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead of himself,
By not confining himself to himself sustains himself outside himself:
By never being an end in himself he endlessly becomes himself.

## Chapter 8

上善若水
The highest virtue is like water –

水善利万物而不争
Water's virtue benefits the ten thousand creatures, yet it does not strive.

处众人之所恶
It dwells in places that everyone detests,

故几于道
Therefore it is almost comparable to Dao!

居善地
In dwelling, the virtue is in the land.

心善渊
In your heart/mind, the virtue is in being profound and deep.

与善仁
In relations, the virtue is in being kind.

言善信
In speech, the virtue is in being truthful.

正善治
In governing, the virtue is in being honest and just.

事善能
In your duties, the virtue is in being competent.

动善时
In action, the virtue is in the timing.

夫唯不争
Now: only because there is no striving,

故无尤
Therefore there is no blame.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The supreme good is like water, which nourishes all things without trying to.
It is content with the low places that people disdain.
Thus it is like the Tao.
In dwelling, live close to the ground.
In thinking, keep to the simple.
In conflict, be fair and generous.
In governing, don't try to control.
In work, do what you enjoy.
In family life, be completely present.
When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Man at his best, like water, serves as he goes along:
Like water he seeks his own level,
The common level of life,
Loves living close to the earth,
Living clear down in his heart,
Loves kinship with his neighbors,
The pick of words that tell the truth,
The even tenor of a well-run state,
The fair profit of able dealing,
The right timing of useful deeds,
And for blocking no one's way no one blames him.

## Chapter 9

持而盈之
Holding and filling it

不如其已
Are not as good as your stopping short.

揣而锐之
Hammering and sharpening it

不可长保
Can not be forever maintained.

金玉满堂
When gold and jade fill a room,

莫之能守
There is no one who can protect it.

富贵而骄
To have wealth and high rank, but with arrogance –

自遗其咎
Then naturally their loss is your own fault.

功遂身退
When the task is successful, the self should let go of it.

天之道
This is the Way of heaven.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Fill your bowl to the brim and it will spill.
Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt.
Chase after money and security and your heart will never unclench.
Care about people's approval and you will be their prisoner.
Do your work, then step back.
The only path to serenity.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Keep stretching a bow you repent of the pull,
A whetted saw goes thin and dull,
Surrounded with treasure you lie ill at ease,
Proud beyond measure you come to your knees:
Do enough, without vieing,
Be living, not dying.

## Chapter 10

载营魄抱一
Carrying and managing a body while embracing the One,

能无离乎
Are you able to not separate them?

专气致柔
Concentrating your Qi to become soft,

能婴儿乎
Are you able to be like a newborn infant?

涤除玄览
Cleansing and clearing your deep and mysterious perception,

能无疵乎
Are you able to be without blemish?

爱民治国
Loving the citizens and governing the nation,

能无为乎
Are you able to use non-action?

天门开阖
Opening and closing the gateway of heaven,

能为雌乎
Are you able to serve as the feminine?

明白四达
Attaining clear insight in all directions,

能无以知乎
Are you able to not use your knowledge?

生之畜之
Creating them and raising them,

生而不有
Creating but not possessing,

为而不恃
Acting but not concerned with the results,

长而不宰
Leading yet not governing –

是谓玄德
This is called deep and mysterious De.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Can you coax your mind from its wandering and keep to the original oneness?
Can you let your body become supple as a newborn child's?
Can you cleanse your inner vision until you see nothing but the light?
Can you love people and lead them without imposing your will?
Can you deal with the most vital matters by letting events take their course?
Can you step back from your own mind and thus understand all things?
Giving birth and nourishing, having without possessing, acting with no expectations, leading and not trying to control: this is the supreme virtue.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Can you hold the door of your tent wide to the firmament?
Can you, with the simple stature of a child, breathing nature, become, notwithstanding, a man?
Can you continue befriending with no prejudice, no ban?
Can you, mating with heaven, serve as the female part?
Can your learned head take leaven from the wisdom of your heart?
If you can bear issue and nourish its growing,
If you can guide without claim or strife,
If you can stay in the lead of men without their knowing,
You are at the core of life.

## Chapter 11

三十辐共一毂
Thirty spokes of a wheel share one hub;

当其无有车之用
In its emptiness exists the usefulness of the cart.

埏埴以为器
Mix water with clay thus making a vessel;

当其无有器之用
In its emptiness exists the usefulness of the vessel.

凿户牖以为室
Cut out doors and windows thus making a room;

当其无有室之用
In their emptiness exists the usefulness of the room.

故有之以为利
Therefore: what exists thus makes a thing profitable;

无之以为用
Emptiness thus makes it useful.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move.
We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want.
We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable.
We work with being, but non-being is what we use.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Thirty spokes are made one by holes in a hub,
By vacancies joining them for a wheel's use;
The use of clay in moulding pitchers comes from the hollow of its absence;
Doors, windows, in a house, are used for their emptiness:
Thus we are helped by what is not to use what is.

## Chapter 12

五色令人目盲
The five colors can make people's eyes blind.

五音令人耳聋
The five tones can make people's ears deaf.

五味令人口爽
The five flavors can make people's mouths dull.

驰骋畋猎令人心发狂
Excessive hunting and horse racing can make people's heart/minds become wild.

难得之货令人行妨
Rare goods can make people's behavior corrupt.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

为腹不为目
Acts on what is inside, he does not act on what he sees.

故去彼取此
Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Colors blind the eye.
Sounds deafen the ear.
Flavors numb the taste.
Thoughts weaken the mind.
Desires wither the heart.
The Master observes the world but trusts his inner vision.
He allows things to come and go.
His heart is open as the sky.

### Witter Bynner Translation
The five colors can blind,
The five tones deafen,
The five tastes cloy.
The race, the hunt, can drive men mad
And their booty leave them no peace.
Therefore a sensible man prefers the inner to the outer eye:
He has his yes, --he has his no.

## Chapter 13

宠辱若惊
Favor and disgrace seem alarming.

贵大患若身
High rank brings great suffering if you have a self.

何谓宠辱若惊
What is meant by "favor and disgrace seem alarming"?

宠为下得之若惊
Favor makes you the inferior, so gaining it seems alarming.

失之若惊
Losing it also seems alarming.

是谓宠辱若惊
This is what is meant by "favor and disgrace seem alarming".

何谓贵大患若身
What is meant by "high rank brings great suffering if you have a self"?

吾所以有大患者为吾有身
I am the reason that I have great suffering, I who act like I have a self.

及吾无身吾有何患
When I am without a self, how could I have suffering?

故贵以身为天下
Therefore: he who is high ranking and uses his self to serve the world –

若可以寄天下
It seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!

爱以身为天下
He who is loving and uses his self to serve the world –

若可以托天下
It seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Success is as dangerous as failure.
Hope is as hollow as fear.
What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure?
Whether you go up the ladder or down it, your position is shaky.
When you stand with your two feet on the ground, you will always keep your balance.
What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?
Hope and fear are both phantoms that arise from thinking of the self.
When we don't see the self as self, what do we have to fear?
See the world as your self.
Have faith in the way things are.
Love the world as your self; then you can care for all things.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Favor and disfavor have been called equal worries,
Success and failure have been called equal ailments.
How can favor and disfavor be called equal worries?
Because winning favor burdens a man with the fear of losing it.
How can success and failure be called equal ailments?
Because a man thinks of the personal body as self.
When he no longer thinks of the personal body as self neither failure nor success can ail him.
One who knows his lot to be the lot of all other men is a safe man to guide them,
One who recognizes all men as members of his own body is a sound man to guard them.

## Chapter 14

视之不见名曰夷
Look, it is not seen; its name is called elusive.

听之不闻名曰希
Listen, it is not heard; its name is called tenuous.

搏之不得名曰微
Grasp, it is not gotten; its name is called subtle and obscure.

此三者不可致诘
These three things can not be investigated any further –

故混而为一
Therefore they blend and become one.

其上不皦
Its highest point is not bright;

其下不昧
Its lowest point is not dark.

绳绳不可名
Continuous and unending!, it can not be named;

复归于无物
It returns to non-existence.

是谓无状之状
It is called the form of that which is without-form;

无物之象
The image of non-existence.

是谓惚恍
It is called confusing and indistinct.

迎之不见其首
Meet it and you do not see its beginning;

随之不见其后
Follow it and you do not see its end.

执古之道
Hold fast to the Way of the ancients

以御今之有
In order to master the present moment.

能知古始
The ability to know the ancient beginning –

是谓道纪
This is called the main principle of Dao.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Look, and it can't be seen.
Listen, and it can't be heard.
Reach, and it can't be grasped.
Above, it isn't bright.
Below, it isn't dark.
Seamless, unnamable, it returns to the realm of nothing.
Form that includes all forms, image without an image, subtle, beyond all conception.
Approach it and there is no beginning; follow it and there is no end.
You can't know it, but you can be it, at ease in your own life.
Just realize where you come from: this is the essence of wisdom.

### Witter Bynner Translation
What we look for beyond seeing and call the unseen,
Listen for beyond hearing and call the unheard,
Grasp for beyond reaching and call the withheld,
Merge beyond understanding in a oneness
Which does not merely rise and give light,
Does not merely set and leave darkness,
But forever sends forth a succession of living things as mysterious
As the unbegotten existence to which they return.
That is why men have called them empty phenomena,
Meaningless images, in a mirage with no face to meet, no back to follow.
Yet one who is anciently aware of existence is master of every moment,
Feels no break since time beyond time in the way life flows.

## Chapter 15

古之善为士者微妙玄通
The virtue of the ancients made they who were scholars subtle, mysterious, obscure, deep, and penetrating.

深不可识
Their mysterious depths can not be understood.

夫唯不可识
Now: only because they can not be understood,

故强为之容
Therefore we try to emulate their appearance:

豫兮若冬涉川
Hesitant!, as if crossing a winter stream.

犹兮若畏四邻
Wary!, as if afraid of their neighbors all around.

俨兮其若客
Respectful!, they are like a visiting guest.

涣兮若冰将释
Yielding!, like ice that is about to to break off.

敦兮其若朴
Honest and genuine!, they are like the uncarved block.

旷兮其若谷
Wide and open!, they are like a valley.

混兮其若浊
Unclear!, they are like muddy water.

孰能浊以静之徐清
Who can take muddy water and use stillness to slowly and gently make it pure and clear?

孰能安以久动之徐生
Who can take what is tranquil and use continual movement to slowly and gently bring it to life?

保此道者不欲盈
He who maintains this Way does not desire to be full.

夫唯不盈
Now: only because he is not full,

是以能蔽而不成
Thus he can be hidden and unfinished.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The ancient Masters were profound and subtle.
Their wisdom was unfathomable.
There is no way to describe it; all we can describe is their appearance.
They were careful as someone crossing an iced-over stream.
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.
Courteous as a guest.
Fluid as melting ice.
Shapable as a block of wood.
Receptive as a valley.
Clear as a glass of water.
Do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles and the water is clear?
Can you remain unmoving till the right action arises by itself?
The Master doesn't seek fulfillment.
Not seeking, not expecting, she is present, and can welcome all things.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Long ago the land was ruled with a wisdom too fine, too deep, to be fully understood
And, since it was beyond men's full understanding, only some of it has come down to us, as in these sayings:
'Alert as a winter-farer on an icy stream,'
'Wary as a man in ambush,'
'Considerate as a welcome guest,'
'Selfless as melting ice,'
'Green as an uncut tree,'
'Open as a valley,'
And this one also, 'Roiled as a torrent,'
Why roiled as a torrent?
Because when a man is in turmoil how shall he find peace save by staying patient till the stream clears?
How can a man's life keep its course if he will not let it flow?
Those who flow as life flows know they need no other force:
They feel no wear, they feel no tear,
They need no mending, no repair.

## Chapter 16

致虚极
Attain the utmost emptiness.

守静笃
Maintain a profound stillness.

万物并作
The ten thousand creatures arise in unison,

吾以观其复
And thus I observe their return.

夫物芸芸各复归其根
Now: all the myriad creatures return to their source.

归根曰静
Returning to the source speaks of stillness.

静是谓复命
Stillness is called returning to the natural order.

复命曰常
Returning to the natural order speaks of the ever-constant.

知常曰明
Knowing the ever-constant speaks of insight.

不知常妄作凶
Not knowing the ever-constant is foolish and creates misfortune.

知常容
Knowing the ever-constant leads to tolerance.

容乃公
Being tolerant leads to being just and unbiased.

公乃王
Being just and unbiased leads to being kingly.

王乃天
Being kingly leads to heaven.

天乃道
Heaven leads to Dao.

道乃久
Dao leads to what endures.

殁身不殆
When the self disappears, there can be no danger.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Empty your mind of all thoughts.
Let your heart be at peace.
Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return.
Each separate being in the universe returns to the common source.
Returning to the source is serenity.
If you don't realize the source, you stumble in confusion and sorrow.
When you realize where you come from, you naturally become tolerant, disinterested, amused, kindhearted as a grandmother, dignified as a king.
Immersed in the wonder of the Tao, you can deal with whatever life brings you, and when death comes, you are ready.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Be utterly humble and you shall hold to the foundation of peace.
Be at one with all these living things which, having arisen and flourished, return to the quiet whence they came,
Like a healthy growth of vegetation falling back upon the root.
Acceptance of this return to the root has been called 'quietism,'
Acceptance of quietism has been condemned as 'fatalism.'
But fatalism is acceptance of destiny
And to accept destiny is to face life with open eyes,
Whereas not to accept destiny is to face death blindfold.
He who is open-eyed is open-minded—
He who is open-minded is open-hearted,
He who is open-hearted is kingly,
He who is kingly is godly,
He who is godly is useful,
He who is useful is infinite,
He who is infinite is immune,
He who is immune is immortal.

## Chapter 17

太上下知有之
The existence of the best ruler is barely known to the people.

其次亲而誉之
Next is one who they love and praise.

其次畏之
Next is one who they fear.

其次侮之
Next is one who they ridicule.

信不足焉有不信
If the ruler does not trust enough, then he will not have anyone's trust.

犹兮其贵言
Thoughtful!, he values his words.

功成事遂
When tasks are accomplished and duties are successful,

百姓皆谓我自然
The 100 families all say "we are naturally so".

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
When the Master governs, the people are hardly aware that he exists.
Next best is a leader who is loved.
Next, one who is feared.
The worst is one who is despised.
If you don't trust the people, you make them untrustworthy.
The Master doesn't talk, he acts.
When his work is done, the people say, "Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!"

### Witter Bynner Translation
A leader is best when people barely know that he exists,
Not so good when people obey and acclaim him,
Worst when they despise him.
'Fail to honor people, they fail to honor you;'
But of a good leader, who talks little,
When his work is done, his aim fulfilled,
They will all say, 'We did this ourselves.'

## Chapter 18

大道废
When the great Dao is abandoned,

有仁义
There exists kindness and morality.

慧智出
When intelligence and wisdom arise,

有大伪
There exists a great deal of deception.

六亲不和
When the six relationships are not in harmony,

有孝慈
There exists devoted children and loving parents.

国家昏乱
When the nation and the families are very confused,

有忠臣
There exists loyal officials.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
When the great Tao is forgotten, goodness and piety appear.
When the body's intelligence declines, cleverness and knowledge step forth.
When there is no peace in the family, filial piety begins.
When the country falls into chaos, patriotism is born.

### Witter Bynner Translation
When people lost sight of the way to live came codes of love and honesty,
Learning came, charity came, hypocrisy took charge;
When differences weakened family ties came benevolent fathers and dutiful sons;
And when lands were disrupted and misgoverned came ministers commended as loyal.

## Chapter 19

绝圣弃智
Renounce sacredness, abandon wisdom,

民利百倍
And the citizens benefit 100-fold.

绝仁弃义
Renounce kindness, abandon morality,

民复孝慈
And the citizens return to being devoted children and loving parents.

绝巧弃利
Renounce cleverness, abandon profit,

盗贼无有
And thieves and bandits will not exist.

此三者以为文不足
These three things thus make a civilized society, but are not enough.

故令有所属
Therefore: to ensure the citizens have a place to belong –

见素
See the simplicity,

抱朴
Embrace the concept of the uncarved block,

少私
Less selfishness,

寡欲
Fewer desires.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Throw away holiness and wisdom, and people will be a hundred times happier.
Throw away morality and justice, and people will do the right thing.
Throw away industry and profit, and there won't be any thieves.
If these three aren't enough, just stay at the center of the circle and let all things take their course.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Rid of formalized wisdom and learning people would be a hundredfold happier,
Rid of conventionalized duty and honor people would find their families dear,
Rid of legalized profiteering people would have no thieves to fear.
These methods of life have failed, all three,
Here is the way, it seems to me:
Set people free, as deep in their hearts they would like to be,
From private greeds and wanton needs.

## Chapter 20

绝学无忧
Renounce learning and be without worry.

唯之与阿
"Yes" together with "yeah" –

相去几何
What is their mutual distance or nearness?

美之与恶
Beautiful together with ugliness –

相去若何
What is their mutual distance or similarity?

人之所畏不可不畏
That which people fear, they are not able to not fear.

荒兮其未央哉
How ridiculous! They are not yet centered!

众人熙熙
Everyone is very festive,

如享太牢
As if enjoying the Tai Lao sacrifice,

如春登台
As if climbing terraces in the spring.

我独泊兮
I alone am unmoved! –

其未兆
Like one who has not yet given any sign,

如婴儿之未孩
Like a newborn infant who does not yet act like a baby.

儽儽兮若无所归
Very tired and worn out!, as if without a place to return to.

众人皆有余
Everyone all has more than they need;

我独若遗
I alone seem to have lost everything.

我愚人之心也哉
I have the heart/mind of a foolish person, indeed!!

沌沌兮
I am very mixed up and confused!

俗人昭昭
Common people are very clear and bright;

我独若昏
I alone seem confused.

俗人察察
Common people are very observant and alert;

我独闷闷
I alone am very gloomy and depressed.

澹兮其若海
Tranquil!, they are like the ocean;

漂兮若无所止
I drift on the wind!, as if without a place to rest.

众人皆有以
Everyone all has a purpose;

我独顽似鄙
I alone am stupid and stubborn, and appear mean and shallow.

我独异于人
I alone am different compared to other people,

而贵食母
And value the food of the mother.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Stop thinking, and end your problems.
What difference between yes and no?
What difference between success and failure?
Must you value what others value, avoid what others avoid?
How ridiculous!
Other people are excited, as though they were at a parade.
I alone don't care, I alone am expressionless, like an infant before it can smile.
Other people have what they need; I alone possess nothing.
I alone drift about, like someone without a home.
I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.
Other people are bright; I alone am dark.
Other people are sharp; I alone am dull.
Other people have a purpose; I alone don't know.
I drift like a wave on the ocean, I blow as aimless as the wind.
I am different from ordinary people.
I drink from the Great Mother's breasts.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Leave off fine learning! End the nuisance of saying yes to this and perhaps to that,
Distinctions with how little difference!
Categorical this, categorical that, what slightest use are they!
If one man leads, another must follow,
How silly that is and how false!
Yet conventional men lead an easy life with all their days feast days,
A constant spring visit to the Tall Tower,
While I am a simpleton, a do-nothing,
Not big enough yet to raise a hand,
Not grown enough to smile,
A homeless, worthless waif.
Men of the world have a surplus of goods, while I am left out, owning nothing.
What a booby I must be not to know my way round, what a fool!
The average man is so crisp and so confident
That I ought to be miserable going on and on like the sea, drifting nowhere.
All these people are making their mark in the world,
While I, pig-headed, awkward, different from the rest,
Am only a glorious infant still nursing at the breast.

## Chapter 21

孔德之容唯道是从
The greatest De is possible only when Dao is followed.

道之为物唯恍唯惚
The action of Dao on creatures is just indistinct, just confusing.

惚兮恍兮其中有象
Confusing! and indistinct!, within it exists image.

恍兮惚兮其中有物
Indistinct! and confusing!, within it exists things.

窈兮冥兮其中有精
Obscure! and dark!, within it exists essence.

其精甚真
Its essence is extremely real and true.

其中有信
Within it exists truth.

自今及古
From the present, reaching to antiquity,

其名不去
Its name has not departed –

以阅众甫
Thus I observe the father of the multitudes.

吾何以知众甫之然哉
How do I thus know the father of the multitudes is like this?

以此
By means of this.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Master keeps her mind always at one with the Tao; that is what gives her her radiance.
The Tao is ungraspable.
How can her mind be at one with it?
Because she doesn't cling to ideas.
The Tao is dark and unfathomable.
How can it make her radiant?
Because she lets it.
Since before time and space were, the Tao is.
It is beyond is and is not.
How do I know this is true?
I look inside myself and see.

### Witter Bynner Translation
The surest test if a man be sane is if he accepts life whole, as it is,
Without needing by measure or touch to understand
The measureless untouchable source of its images,
The measureless untouchable source of its substances,
The source which, while it appears dark emptiness, brims with a quick force
Farthest away and yet nearest at hand
From oldest time unto this day,
Charging its images with origin:
What more need I know of the origin than this?

## Chapter 22

曲则全
What is wrong then becomes whole and perfect.

枉则直
What is bent then becomes straight.

洼则盈
What is hollow then becomes filled.

敝则新
What is worn out then becomes new.

少则得
Have little, then gain.

多则惑
Have too much, then become confused.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

抱一以为天下式
Embraces the One, thus serving as an example to the world –

不自见故明
He does not display himself, therefore he has insight.

不自是故彰
Does not consider himself correct, therefore he distinguishes himself.

不自伐故有功
Does not boast about himself, therefore he possesses merit.

不自矜故长
Does not brag about himself, therefore he endures.

夫唯不争
Now: only because he does not strive,

故天下莫能与之争
Therefore no one in the world can strive against him.

古之所谓
That which the ancients say:

曲则全者
"He who is wrong then becomes whole and perfect" –

岂虚言哉
How can these be empty words?

诚全而归之
Be truly whole and perfect, and return to it.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
If you want to become whole, let yourself be partial.
If you want to become straight, let yourself be crooked.
If you want to become full, let yourself be empty.
If you want to be reborn, let yourself die.
If you want to be given everything, give everything up.
The Master, by residing in the Tao, sets an example for all beings.
Because he doesn't display himself, people can see his light.
Because he has nothing to prove, people can trust his words.
Because he doesn't know who he is, people recognize themselves in him.
Because he has no goal in mind, everything he does succeeds.
When the ancient Masters said, "If you want to be given everything, give everything up," they weren't using empty phrases.
Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself.

### Witter Bynner Translation
'Yield and you need not break:'
Bent you can straighten,
Emptied you can hold,
Torn you can mend;
And as want can reward you so wealth can bewilder.
Aware of this, a wise man has the simple return which other men seek:
Without inflaming himself he is kindled,
Without explaining himself is explained,
Without taking credit is accredited,
Laying no claim is acclaimed
And, because he does not compete, finds peaceful competence.
How true is the old saying, 'Yield and you need not break'!
How completely it comes home!

## Chapter 23

希言自然
Minimal words are naturally so.

故飘风不终朝
Therefore: strong winds do not last the entire morning,

骤雨不终日
Sudden rains do not last the entire day.

孰为此者天地
Who makes these things? Heaven and earth.

天地尚不能久
Even heaven and earth can not maintain them forever,

而况于人乎
And so how much less can people?

故从事于道者
Therefore: of those who engage in Dao –

道者同于道
He who Daos is one with Dao.

德者同于德
He who Des is one with De.

失者同于失
He who loses is one with the loss.

同于道者
For he who is one with Dao,

道亦乐得之
Dao is also pleased to have him.

同于德者
For he who is one with De,

德亦乐得之
De is also pleased to have him.

同于失者
For he who is one with loss,

失亦乐得之
Loss is also pleased to have him.

信不足焉有不信
If you do not trust enough, then you will not have anyone's trust.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Express yourself completely, then keep quiet.
Be like the forces of nature: when it blows, there is only wind; when it rains, there is only rain; when the clouds pass, the sun shines through.
If you open yourself to the Tao, you are at one with the Tao and you can embody it completely.
If you open yourself to insight, you are at one with insight and you can use it completely.
If you open yourself to loss, you are at one with loss and you can accept it completely.
Open yourself to the Tao, then trust your natural responses; and everything will fall into place.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Nature does not have to insist, can blow for only half a morning,
Rain for only half a day,
And what are these winds and these rains but natural?
If nature does not have to insist, why should man?
It is natural too that whoever follows the way of life feels alive,
That whoever uses it properly feels well used,
Whereas he who loses the way of life feels lost,
That whoever keeps to the way of life feels at home,
Whoever uses it properly feels welcome,
Whereas he who uses it improperly feels improperly used:
'Fail to honor people, they fail to honor you.'

## Chapter 24

企者不立
He who stands on tiptoe does not really stand.

跨者不行
He who stands astride can not travel.

自见者不明
He who displays himself does not have insight.

自是者不彰
He who considers himself correct does not distinguish himself.

自伐者无功
He who boasts about himself is without merit.

自矜者不长
He who brags about himself does not endure.

其在道也
He who lives in Dao –

曰余食赘行
Calls these leftover food and unnecessary behavior.

物或恶之
Creatures detest them, no matter what.

故有道者不处
Therefore: he who possesses Dao does not live by them.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
He who stands on tiptoe doesn't stand firm.
He who rushes ahead doesn't go far.
He who tries to shine dims his own light.
He who defines himself can't know who he really is.
He who has power over others can't empower himself.
He who clings to his work will create nothing that endures.
If you want to accord with the Tao, just do your job, then let go.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Standing tiptoe a man loses balance,
Walking astride he has no pace,
Kindling himself he fails to light,
Acquitting himself he forfeits his hearers,
Admiring himself he does so alone.
Pride has never brought a man greatness
But, according to the way of life, brings the ills that make him unfit,
Make him unclean in the eyes of his neighbor,
And a sane man will have none of them.

## Chapter 25

有物混成
Something existed unformed yet complete,

先天地生
Before heaven and earth were created.

寂兮寥兮
Silent! Empty!

独立不改
Standing alone, not changing.

周行而不殆
It circulates everywhere, and causes no danger.

可以为天下母
It can be considered the mother of the world.

吾不知其名
I do not know its name;

字之曰道
Its symbol is called Dao.

强为之名曰大
If I tried to make its name, I would call it great.

大曰逝
Being great speaks of departing.

逝曰远
Departing speaks of being remote.

远曰反
Being remote speaks of returning.

道大
Dao is great,

天大
Heaven is great,

地大
Earth is great,

王亦大
The king is also great.

域中有四大
Within the realm exist four that are great,

而王居其一焉
And the king resides as one of them!

人法地
People follow the earth.

地法天
The earth follows heaven.

天法道
Heaven follows Dao.

道法自然
Dao follows what is naturally so.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
There was something formless and perfect before the universe was born.
It is serene. Empty. Solitary. Unchanging. Infinite. Eternally present.
It is the mother of the universe.
For lack of a better name, I call it the Tao.
It flows through all things, inside and outside, and returns to the origin of all things.
The Tao is great.
The universe is great.
Earth is great.
Man is great.
These are the four great powers.
Man follows the earth.
Earth follows the universe.
The universe follows the Tao.
The Tao follows only itself.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Before creation a prescience existed, self-contained, complete,
Formless, voiceless, mateless, changeless,
Which yet pervaded itself with unending motherhood.
Though there can be no name for it, I have called it 'the way of life.'
Perhaps I should have called it 'the fullness of life,'
Since fullness implies widening into space,
Implies still further widening,
Implies widening until the circle is whole.
In this sense the way of life is fulfilled,
Heaven is fulfilled,
Earth fulfilled
And a fit man also is fulfilled:
These are the four amplitudes of the universe
And a fit man is one of them:
Man rounding the way of earth,
Earth rounding the way of heaven,
Heaven rounding the way of life till the circle is full.

## Chapter 26

重为轻根
Serious serves as the source of frivolous.

静为躁君
Stillness serves as the ruler of restlessness.

是以君子终日
Thus the noble man travels the entire day,

行不离其辎重
And does not stray from his wagon.

雖有荣观燕处超然
He is serious, even though glorious sights and feasts exist;

奈何万乘之主
So how could one be the master of ten thousand chariots,

而以身轻天下
And conduct his self frivolously in the world?

轻则失本
Be frivolous, then lose the source.

躁则失君
Be restless, then lose the rulership.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The heavy is the root of the light.
The unmoved is the source of all movement.
Thus the Master travels all day without leaving home.
However splendid the views, she stays serenely in herself
Why should the lord of the country flit about like a fool?
If you let yourself be blown to and fro, you lose touch with your root.
If you let restlessness move you, you lose touch with who you are.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Gravity is the root of grace, the mainstay of all speed.
A traveler of true means, whatever the day's pace, remembers the provision-van
And, however fine prospect be offered, is a man with a calm head.
What lord of countless chariots would ride them in vain,
Would make himself fool of the realm, with pace beyond rein, speed beyond helm?

## Chapter 27

善行无辙迹
A good traveler is without wagon track or footprint.

善言无瑕谪
A good speaker is without flaw or disgrace.

善数不用筹策
A good accountant does not use counting tokens.

善闭无关楗而不可开
A good barrier is without bar or lock, yet can not be opened.

善结无纆约而不可解
A good binding is without cord or restraint, yet can not be loosened.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

常善救人
Is always good at helping people,

故无弃人
Therefore he does not abandon people.

常善救物
Is always good at helping creatures,

故无弃物
Therefore he does not abandon creatures.

是谓袭明
This is called following your insight.

故善人者不善人之师
Therefore: he who is a virtuous person is the teacher of he who is not a virtuous person.

不善人者善人之资
He who is not a virtuous person is the resource of he who is a virtuous person.

不贵其师
If the latter does not value his teacher,

不爱其资
Or the former does not love his resource,

虽智大迷
Even if there is wisdom, there will be great confusion.

是谓要妙
This is called the essential subtle mystery.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving.
A good artist lets his intuition lead him wherever it wants.
A good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is.
Thus the Master is available to all people and doesn't reject anyone.
He is ready to use all situations and doesn't waste anything.
This is called embodying the light.
What is a good man but a bad man's teacher?
What is a bad man but a good man's job?
If you don't understand this, you will get lost, however intelligent you are.
It is the great secret.

### Witter Bynner Translation
One may move so well that a foot-print never shows,
Speak so well that the tongue never slips,
Reckon so well that no counter is needed,
Seal an entrance so tight, though using no lock, that it cannot be opened,
Bind a hold so firm, though using no cord, that it cannot be untied.
And these are traits not only of a sound man but of many a man thought to be unsound.
A sound man is good at salvage, at seeing that nothing is lost.
Having what is called insight, a good man, before he can help a bad man,
Finds in himself the matter with the bad man.
And whichever teacher discounts the lesson is as far off the road as the other,
Whatever else he may know.
That is the heart of it.

## Chapter 28

知其雄守其雌
Know your maleness, but maintain your femaleness.

为天下溪
Serve as a stream to the world.

为天下溪
Serving as a stream to the world,

常德不离
The ever-constant De will not depart,

复归于婴儿
Returning you to the state of the newborn infant.

知其白守其黑
Know your brightness, but maintain your darkness.

为天下式
Serve as an example to the world.

为天下式
Serving as an example to the world,

常德不忒
The ever-constant De will not falter,

复归于无极
Returning you to the state of the limitless.

知其荣守其辱
Know your honor, but maintain your disgrace.

为天下谷
Serve as a valley to the world.

为天下谷
Serving as a valley to the world,

常德乃足
The ever-constant De will then be sufficient,

复归于朴
Returning you to the state of the uncarved block.

朴散则为器
When the uncarved block is broken up, then it becomes tools.

圣人用之则为官长
When the sage uses it, then he becomes the senior government official.

故大制不割
Therefore: the greatest cutting does not divide.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Know the male, yet keep to the female: receive the world in your arms.
If you receive the world, the Tao will never leave you and you will be like a little child.
Know the white, yet keep to the black: be a pattern for the world.
If you are a pattern for the world, the Tao will be strong inside you and there will be nothing you can't do.
Know the personal, yet keep to the impersonal: accept the world as it is.
If you accept the world, the Tao will be luminous inside you and you will return to your primal self.
The world is formed from the void, like utensils from a block of wood.
The Master knows the utensils, yet keeps to the block: thus she can use all things.

### Witter Bynner Translation
'One who has a man's wings and a woman's also is in himself a womb of the world'
And, being a womb of the world, continuously, endlessly, gives birth;
One who, preferring light, prefers darkness also is in himself an image of the world
And, being an image of the world, is continuously, endlessly the dwelling of creation;
One who is highest of men and humblest also is in himself a valley of the world,
And, being a valley of the world, continuously, endlessly conducts the one source
From which vessels may be usefully filled;
Servants of the state are such vessels, to be filled from undiminishing supply.

## Chapter 29

将欲取天下而为之
Would you take hold of the world and control it?

吾见其不得已
I see you have no choice.

夫天下神器
Now: the world is a divine vessel,

不可为也
You can not control it (indeed!).

为者败之
He who acts, ruins it;

执者失之
He who grasps, loses it.

故物
Therefore: creatures are

或行或随
Sometimes active, sometimes passive,

或歔或吹
Sometimes breathe heavy, sometimes breathe easy,

或强或羸
Sometimes strong, sometimes weak,

或挫或隳
Sometimes oppressed, sometimes overthrown.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

去甚
Removes the extremes,

去奢
Removes the extravagant and wasteful,

去泰
Removes the arrogance.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Do you want to improve the world?
I don't think it can be done.
The world is sacred.
It can't be improved.
If you tamper with it, you'll ruin it.
If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it.
There is a time for being ahead, a time for being behind; a time for being in motion, a time for being at rest; a time for being vigorous, a time for being exhausted; a time for being safe, a time for being in danger.
The Master sees things as they are, without trying to control them.
She lets them go their own way, and resides at the center of the circle.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Those who would take over the earth and shape it to their will never, I notice, succeed.
The earth is like a vessel so sacred that at the mere approach of the profane it is marred
And when they reach out their fingers it is gone.
For a time in the world some force themselves ahead and some are left behind,
For a time in the world some make a great noise and some are held silent,
For a time in the world some are puffed fat and some are kept hungry,
For a time in the world some push aboard and some are tipped out:
At no time in the world will a man who is sane over-reach himself, over-spend himself, over-rate himself.

## Chapter 30

以道佐人主者
He who uses Dao to assist the master of the people

不以兵强天下
Does not use weapons or strength on the world,

其事好还
For his troubles would likely return –

师之所处荆棘生
In the dwelling places of armies, thorns and brambles are produced,

焉大军之后必有凶年
And so what is left behind a great army must have a bad year.

善者果而已
He who has virtue gets results and stops.

不敢以取强
He does not dare to take by using strength.

果而勿矜
He gets results, but never brags.

果而勿伐
Gets results, but never boasts.

果而勿骄
Gets results, but is not arrogant.

果而不得已
Gets results, but only when he has no choice.

果而勿强
Gets results, but never uses strength.

物壮则老
When creatures are robust but old,

是谓不道
This is called "not Dao".

不道早已
That which is "not Dao" has an early finish.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men doesn't try to force issues or defeat enemies by force of arms.
For every force there is a counterforce.
Violence, even well intentioned, always rebounds upon oneself.
The Master does his job and then stops.
He understands that the universe is forever out of control, and that trying to dominate events goes against the current of the Tao.
Because he believes in himself, he doesn't try to convince others.
Because he is content with himself, he doesn't need others' approval.
Because he accepts himself, the whole world accepts him.

### Witter Bynner Translation
One who would guide a leader of men in the uses of life will warn him against the use of arms for conquest.
Weapons often turn upon the wielder, an army's harvest is a waste of thorns,
Conscription of a multitude of men drains the next year dry.
A good general, daring to march, dares also to halt,
Will never press his triumph beyond need.
What he must do he does but not for glory,
What he must do he does but not for show,
What he must do he does but not for self;
He has done it because it had to be done, not from a hot head.
Let life ripen and then fall, force is not the way at all:
Deny the way of life and you are dead.

## Chapter 31

夫佳兵者不祥之器
Now: fine weapons, they are not tools of good fortune.

物或恶之
Creatures detest them, no matter what.

故有道者不处
Therefore: he who possesses Dao does not live by them.

君子居则贵左
When a noble man is in his dwelling, then he honors the left.

用兵则贵右
When he commands troops, then he honors the right.

兵者不祥之器
Weapons, they are not tools of good fortune.

非君子之器
They are not the tools of a noble man.

不得已而用之
When he has no choice but to use them,

恬淡为上
To be calm and indifferent is superior –

勿美也
Never pleased, indeed!

而美之者是乐杀人
And he who is pleased enjoys killing people.

夫乐杀人者
Now: he who enjoys killing people

不可以得志于天下矣
Can not get what he desires from the world!

故吉事尚左
Therefore: in fortunate affairs honor the left,

凶事尚右
In unfortunate affairs honor the right.

是以偏将军居左
Thus the assistant general of the army resides on the left,

上将军居右
The supreme general of the army resides on the right.

言以丧礼处之
Thus we say they are dwelling at a funeral:

杀人众
When many people are killed,

以哀悲泣之
Then mourn and weep with grief for them.

战胜以丧礼处之
Victory in war thus means they will dwell at a funeral.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Weapons are the tools of violence; all decent men detest them.
Weapons are the tools of fear; a decent man will avoid them except in the direst necessity and, if compelled, will use them only with the utmost restraint.
Peace is his highest value.
If the peace has been shattered, how can he be content?
His enemies are not demons, but human beings like himself.
He doesn't wish them personal harm.
Nor does he rejoice in victory.
How could he rejoice in victory and delight in the slaughter of men?
He enters a battle gravely, with sorrow and with great compassion, as if he were attending a funeral.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Even the finest arms are an instrument of evil, a spread of plague,
And the way for a vital man to go is not the way of a soldier.
But in time of war men civilized in peace turn from their higher to their lower nature.
Arms are an instrument of evil, no measure for thoughtful men
Until there fail all other choice but sad acceptance of it.
Triumph is not beautiful.
He who thinks triumph beautiful is one with a will to kill,
And one with a will to kill shall never prevail upon the world.
It is a good sign when man's higher nature comes forward,
A bad sign when his lower nature comes forward,
When retainers take charge and the master stays back as in the conduct of a funeral.
The death of a multitude is cause for mourning:
Conduct your triumph as a funeral.

## Chapter 32

道常无名
Dao is ever-constantly without-name.

朴虽小
Even though the concept of the uncarved block seems insignificant,

天下莫能臣
No one in the world can conquer it.

侯王若能守之
If nobles and kings could maintain it,

万物将自宾
The ten thousand creatures would naturally obey.

天地相合
Heaven and earth would join with each other,

以降甘露
Thus dropping a sweet dew.

民莫之令
There are no citizens who would make this happen,

而自均
Yet it would be naturally fair and impartial.

焉始制有名
And so, begin to divide and you have names.

名亦既有
Once names exist,

夫亦将知止
Men should also be ready to know when to stop.

知止所以不殆
Knowing when to stop is the reason that there is no danger.

譬道之在天下
An analogy for the action of Dao in the world:

猶川谷之与江海
It is similar to a stream in a valley that becomes part of a large river or ocean.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao can't be perceived, Smaller than an electron, it contains uncountable galaxies.
If powerful men and women could remain centered in the Tao, all things would be in harmony.
The world would become a paradise.
All people would be at peace, and the law would be written in their hearts.
When you have names and forms, know that they are provisional.
When you have institutions, know where their functions should end.
Knowing when to stop, you can avoid any danger.
All things end in the Tao as rivers flow into the sea.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Existence is infinite, not to be defined;
And, though it seem but a bit of wood in your hand, to carve as you please,
It is not to be lightly played with and laid down.
When rulers adhered to the way of life, they were upheld by natural loyalty:
Heaven and earth were joined and made fertile,
Life was a freshness of rain, subject to none, free to all.
But men of culture came, with their grades and their distinctions;
And as soon as such differences had been devised no one knew where to end them,
Though the one who does know the end of all such differences is the sound man:
Existence might be likened to the course of many rivers reaching the one sea.

## Chapter 33

知人者智
He who knows people is wise;

自知者明
He who knows himself has insight.

胜人者有力
He who is victorious over people possesses power;

自胜者强
He who is victorious over himself is strong.

知足者富
He who knows he has enough is wealthy;

强行者有志
He who uses force possesses ambition.

不失其所者久
He who does not lose his place endures;

死而不亡者寿
He who dies yet does not perish has longevity.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom.
Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.
If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich.
If you stay in the center and embrace death with your whole heart, you will endure forever.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Knowledge studies others, wisdom is self-known;
Muscle masters brothers, self-mastery is bone;
Content need never borrow, ambition wanders blind:
Vitality cleaves to the marrow leaving death behind.

## Chapter 34

大道氾兮
Great Dao is like a vast flood!

其可左右
It is able to flow left and right.

万物恃之以生
The ten thousand creatures depend on it in order for life,

而不辞
And are not rejected.

功成遂
It accomplishes its tasks successfully,

而不名有
Yet does not possess a name.

衣养万物
It clothes and supports the ten thousand creatures,

而不为主
But does not act as their master.

故常无欲
Therefore: since it is ever-constantly without-desire,

可名于小
It can then be named insignificant.

万物归焉
Since the ten thousand creatures return to it

而不为主
But it does not act as their master,

可名于大
It can then be named great.

是以圣人之能成大
Thus the sage can achieve greatness

以其不为大
Because he does not act great.

故能成大
Therefore he can achieve greatness.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The great Tao flows everywhere.
All things are born from it, yet it doesn't create them.
It pours itself into its work, yet it makes no claim.
It nourishes infinite worlds, yet it doesn't hold on to them.
Since it is merged with all things and hidden in their hearts, it can be called humble.
Since all things vanish into it and it alone endures, it can be called great.
It isn't aware of its greatness; thus it is truly great.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Bountiful life, letting anyone attend, making no distinction between left or right.
Feeding everyone, refusing no one, has not provided this bounty to show how much it owns,
Has not fed and clad its guests with any thought of claim;
And, because it lacks the twist of mind or body in what it has done,
The guile of head or hands, is not always respected by a guest.
Others appreciate welcome from the perfect host
Who, barely appearing to exist, exists the most.

## Chapter 35

执大象
Holding fast to the great image,

天下往
The entire world comes towards you.

往而不害
Comes towards you, and meeting with no harm,

安平太
There is the greatest peace and calm.

乐与饵过客止
Music together with good food make passing guests stay,

道之出言淡
But Dao's words are bland!

其无味
They are without flavor.

视之不足见
Look for it, there is not enough to see.

听之不足闻
Listen for it, there is not enough to hear.

用之不足既
Use it, there is not enough to exhaust.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
She who is centered in the Tao can go where she wishes, without danger.
She perceives the universal harmony, even amid great pain, because she has found peace in her heart.
Music or the smell of good cooking may make people stop and enjoy.
But words that point to the Tao seem monotonous and without flavor.
When you look for it, there is nothing to see.
When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear.
When you use it, it is inexhaustible.

### Witter Bynner Translation
If the sign of life is in your face he who responds to it
Will feel secure and fit as when, in a friendly place,
Sure of hearty care, a traveler gladly waits.
Though it may not taste like food and he may not see the fare
Or hear a sound of plates, how endless it is and how good!

## Chapter 36

将欲歙之
When you are about to gather something,

必固张之
You must have originally spread it out.

将欲弱之
When you are about to weaken something,

必固强之
You must have originally strengthened it.

将欲废之
When you are about to abandon something,

必固兴之
You must have originally been interested in it.

将欲夺之
When you are about to seize something,

必固与之
You must have originally given it.

是谓微明
This is called subtle and obscure insight.

柔弱胜刚强
What is soft and weak conquers what is hard and strong.

鱼不可脱于渊
Fish can not escape from the deep;

国之利器
The sharp tools of the nation

不可以示人
Can not be shown to the people.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
If you want to shrink something, you must first allow it to expand.
If you want to get rid of something, you must first allow it to flourish.
If you want to take something, you must first allow it to be given.
This is called the subtle perception of the way things are.
The soft overcomes the hard.
The slow overcomes the fast.
Let your workings remain a mystery.
Just show people the results.

### Witter Bynner Translation
He who feels punctured must once have been a bubble,
He who feels unarmed must have carried arms,
He who feels belittled must have been consequential,
He who feels deprived must have had privilege,
Whereas a man with insight knows that to keep under is to endure.
What happens to a fish pulled out of a pond?
Or to an implement of state pulled out of a scabbard?
Unseen, they survive.

## Chapter 37

道常无为
Dao ever-constantly practices non-action,

而无不为
Yet nothing is left undone.

侯王若能守之
If nobles and kings could maintain it,

万物将自化
The ten thousand creatures would naturally transform.

化而欲作
Transform, and if desire arises,

吾将镇之以无名之朴
I would restrain it by means of the nameless uncarved block.

无名之朴
In the state of the nameless uncarved block,

夫亦将无欲
Men also would be without-desire.

不欲以静
Not desiring, thus they would be still –

天下将自定
And the world would naturally settle.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao never does anything, yet through it all things are done.
If powerful men and women could center themselves in it, the whole world would be transformed by itself, in its natural rhythms.
People would be content with their simple, everyday lives, in harmony, and free of desire.
When there is no desire, all things are at peace.

### Witter Bynner Translation
The way to use life is to do nothing through acting,
The way to use life is to do everything through being.
When a leader knows this, his land naturally goes straight.
And the world's passion to stray from straightness is checked at the core
By the simple unnamable cleanness through which men cease from coveting,
And to a land where men cease from coveting peace comes of course.

## Chapter 38

上德不德是以有德
A man of highest De does not use his De, thus he possesses De.

下德不失德是以无德
A man of inferior De does not lose his De, thus he is without De.

上德无为而无以为
A man of highest De uses non-action, and acts without motive.

下德为之而有以为
A man of inferior De coerces others, and has a motive to act.

上仁为之而无以为
A man of highest kindness coerces others, and acts without motive.

上义为之而有以为
A man of highest morality coerces others, and has a motive to act.

上礼为之而莫之以应
A man of highest propriety coerces others, and if there is no one who responds,

则攘臂而仍之
Then he rolls up his sleeves and keeps doing it.

故失道而后德
Therefore: lose Dao, and later comes De.

失德而后仁
Lose De, and later comes kindness.

失仁而后义
Lose kindness, and later comes morality.

失义而后礼
Lose morality, and later comes propriety.

夫礼者忠信之薄
Now: propriety is that which is merely the appearance of loyalty and honesty,

而乱之首
And the beginning of confusion.

前识者道之华
He who is ahead in knowledge has the flower of Dao,

而愚之始
But the beginning of stupidity and foolishness.

是以大丈夫
Thus the greatest elders:

处其厚不居其薄
Live by Dao's substance, and do not dwell on Dao's appearance.

处其实不居其华
Live on Dao's fruit, and do not dwell on Dao's flower.

故去彼取此
Therefore they leave that and choose this.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Master doesn't try to be powerful; thus he is truly powerful.
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power; thus he never has enough.
The Master does nothing, yet he leaves nothing undone.
The ordinary man is always doing things, yet many more are left to be done.
The kind man does something, yet something remains undone.
The just man does something, and leaves many things to be done.
The moral man does something, and when no one responds he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.
When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.
When goodness is lost, there is morality.
When morality is lost, there is ritual.
Ritual is the husk of true faith, the beginning of chaos.
Therefore the Master concerns himself with the depths and not the surface, with the fruit and not the flower.
He has no will of his own.
He dwells in reality, and lets all illusions go.

### Witter Bynner Translation
A man of sure fitness, without making a point of his fitness, stays fit;
A man of unsure fitness, assuming an appearance of fitness, becomes unfit.
The man of sure fitness never makes an act of it nor considers what it may profit him;
The man of unsure fitness makes an act of it and considers what it may profit him.
However a man with a kind heart proceed, he forgets what it may profit him;
However a man with a just mind proceed, he remembers what it may profit him;
However a man of conventional conduct proceed, if he be not complied with
Out goes his fist to enforce compliance.
Here is what happens:
Losing the way of life, men rely first on their fitness;
Losing fitness, they turn to kindness;
Losing kindness, they turn to justness;
Losing justness, they turn to convention.
Conventions are fealty and honesty gone to waste, they are the entrance of disorder.
False teachers of life use flowery words and start nonsense.
The man of stamina stays with the root below the tapering,
Stays with the fruit beyond the flowering:
He has his no and he has his yes.

## Chapter 39

昔之得一者
Of those who in ancient times attained oneness:

天得一以清
Heaven attained oneness, thus becoming pure and clear.

地得一以宁
Earth attained oneness, thus becoming stable.

神得一以灵
Spirit attained oneness, thus becoming potent.

谷得一以盈
The valley attained oneness, thus becoming full.

万物得一以生
The ten thousand creatures attained oneness, thus becoming alive.

侯王得一以为天下贞
Nobles and kings attained oneness, thus serving the world faithfully.

其致之
They attained it.

天无以清
If heaven could not use its purity and clarity,

将恐裂
I fear it would split apart.

地无以宁
If earth could not use its stability,

将恐发
I fear it would erupt.

神无以灵
If spirit could not use its potency,

将恐歇
I fear it would cease to be.

谷无以盈
If the valley could not use its fullness,

将恐竭
I fear it would be used up.

万物无以生
If the ten thousand creatures could not use their life,

将恐灭
I fear they would be destroyed.

侯王无以贵高
If nobles and kings could not use their high rank and prominence,

将恐蹶
I fear they would fall.

故贵以贱为本
Therefore: humility thus serves as the source of high rank;

高以下为基
Low thus serves as the foundation of high.

是以侯王自谓孤寡不谷
Thus nobles and kings call themselves orphaned, lonely, and unlucky.

此非以贱为本邪
Does this not mean that humility thus serves as the source?

非乎
Does it not?

故致数舆无舆
Therefore: to attain exceptional popularity is to be without popularity –

不欲琭琭如玉
Do not desire to be scarce like jade,

珞珞如石
But common like rock.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
In harmony with the Tao, the sky is clear and spacious, the earth is solid and full, all creatures flourish together, content with the way they are, endlessly repeating themselves, endlessly renewed.
When man interferes with the Tao, the sky becomes filthy, the earth becomes depleted, the equilibrium crumbles, creatures become extinct.
The Master views the parts with compassion, because he understands the whole.
His constant practice is humility.
He doesn't glitter like a jewel but lets himself be shaped by the Tao, as rugged and common as a stone.

### Witter Bynner Translation
The wholeness of life has, from of old, been made manifest in its parts:
Clarity has been made manifest in heaven,
Firmness in earth,
Purity in the spirit,
In the valley conception,
In the river procreation;
And so in a leader are the people made manifest for wholeness of use.
But for clarity heaven would be veiled,
But for firmness earth would have crumbled,
But for purity spirit would have fumbled,
But for conception the valley would have failed,
But for procreation the river have run dry;
So, save for the people, a leader shall die:
Always the low carry the high on a root for growing by.
What can stand lofty with no low foundation?
No wonder leaders of a land profess their stature and their station
To be servitude and lowliness!
If rim and spoke and hub were not, where would be the chariot?
Who will prefer the jingle of jade pendants if
He once has heard stone growing in a cliff!

## Chapter 40

反者道之动
The movement of Dao returns things.

弱者道之用
The function of Dao is to weaken things.

天下万物生于有
The ten thousand creatures of the world are created from being;

有生于无
Being is created from non-being.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Return is the movement of the Tao.
Yielding is the way of the Tao.
All things are born of being.
Being is born of non-being.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Life on its way returns into a mist,
Its quickness is its quietness again:
Existence of this world of things and men
Renews their never needing to exist.

## Chapter 41

上士闻道勤而行之
The superior scholar hearing of Dao works hard and practices it.

中士闻道若存若亡
The average scholar hearing of Dao seems to keep it, seems to lose it.

下士闻道大笑之
The inferior scholar hearing of Dao laughs greatly at it.

不笑不足以为道
If he did not laugh, it would not be qualified to be Dao.

故建言有之
Therefore: in the established sayings that exist, it is said –

明道若昧
Insight into Dao seems like darkness.

进道若退
Advancing in Dao seems like retreating.

夷道若纇
Smooth Dao seems knotted.

上德若谷
Superior De seems like a valley.

大白若辱
The greatest purity seems like disgrace.

广德若不足
The most extensive De seems like it is not enough.

建德若偷
Established De seems aimless.

质真若渝
Real and true character seems inconsistent.

大方无隅
The greatest region is without borders.

大器晚成
The greatest vessel is last to be completed.

大音希声
The greatest tone is a tenuous sound.

大象无形
The greatest image is without-form.

道隐无名
Dao is hidden and without-name.

夫唯道善始且善成
Now: only Dao is good at beginning and also good at completing.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
When a superior man hears of the Tao, he immediately begins to embody it.
When an average man hears of the Tao, he half believes it, half doubts it.
When a foolish man hears of the Tao, he laughs out loud.
If he didn't laugh, it wouldn't be the Tao.
Thus it is said: The path into the light seems dark, the path forward seems to go back, the direct path seems long, true power seems weak, true purity seems tarnished, true steadfastness seems changeable, true clarity seems obscure, the greatest art seems unsophisticated, the greatest love seems indifferent, the greatest wisdom seems childish.
The Tao is nowhere to be found.
Yet it nourishes and completes all things.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Men of stamina, knowing the way of life, steadily keep to it;
Unstable men, knowing the way of life, keep to it or not according to occasion;
Stupid men, knowing the way of life and having once laughed at it, laugh again the louder.
If you need to be sure which way is right, you can tell by their laughing at it.
They fling the old charges:
'A wick without oil,'
'For every step forward a step or two back.'
To such laughers a level road looks steep, top seems bottom,
'White appears black,
'Enough is a lack,'
Endurance is a weakness, simplicity a faded flower.
But eternity is his who goes straight round the circle,
Foundation is his who can feel beyond touch,
Harmony is his who can hear beyond sound,
Pattern is his who can see beyond shape:
Life is his who can tell beyond words fulfillment of the unfulfilled.

## Chapter 42

道生一
Dao creates one.

一生二
One creates two.

二生三
Two creates three.

三生万物
Three creates the ten thousand creatures.

万物负阴而抱阳
The ten thousand creatures carry Yin and embrace Yang,

冲气以为和
Pouring their Qi together, thus becoming harmonious.

人之所恶
That which people detest:

唯孤寡不谷
Being alone, orphaned, lonely, and unlucky –

而王公以自称
Yet kings and nobles thus name themselves.

故物
Therefore: creatures

或损之而益
Sometimes lose, yet they gain;

或益之而损
Sometimes gain, yet they lose.

人之所教我亦教之
That which people teach, I also teach:

强梁者不得其死
Those who are bullies and hoodlums do not meet their natural death.

吾将以为教父
I will thus become their elder teacher.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao gives birth to One.
One gives birth to Two.
Two gives birth to Three.
Three gives birth to all things.
All things have their backs to the female and stand facing the male.
When male and female combine, all things achieve harmony.
Ordinary men hate solitude.
But the Master makes use of it, embracing his aloneness, realizing he is one with the whole universe.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Life, when it came to be, bore one, then two, then three elements of things;
And thus the three began—heaven and earth and man—to balance happenings:
Cool night behind, warm day ahead, for the living, for the dead.
Though a commoner be loth to say that he is only common clay,
Kings and princes often state how humbly they are leading,
Because in true succeeding high and low correlate.
It is an ancient thought, which many men have taught,
That he who over-reaches and tries to live by force
Shall die thereby of course, and is what my own heart teaches.

## Chapter 43

天下之至柔
The softest things of the world

驰骋天下之至坚
Overrun the hardest things of the world.

无有入无间
Non-being can enter where there is no space in between.

吾是以知无为之有益
Thus I know that non-action has benefits.

不言之教
The teaching of no-talking,

无为之益
The benefit of non-action –

天下希及之
Few in the world attain these.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The gentlest thing in the world overcomes the hardest thing in the world.
That which has no substance enters where there is no space.
This shows the value of non-action.
Teaching without words, performing without actions: that is the Master's way.

### Witter Bynner Translation
As the soft yield of water cleaves obstinate stone,
So to yield with life solves the insoluble:
To yield, I have learned, is to come back again.
But this unworded lesson, this easy example, is lost upon men.

## Chapter 44

名与身孰亲
Fame and self: which do you love?

身与货孰多
Self and property: which is greater?

得与亡孰病
Gain and loss: which is the affliction?

甚爱必大费
Extreme desire must lead to great expense.

多藏必厚亡
Collecting too much must lead to substantial loss.

知足不辱
Knowing when you have enough, there can be no disgrace.

知止不殆
Knowing when to stop, there can be no danger.

可以长久
Then you can forever endure.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Fame or integrity: which is more important?
Money or happiness: which is more valuable?
Success or failure: which is more destructive?
If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never truly be fulfilled.
If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself
Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are.
When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Which means more to you, you or your renown?
Which brings more to you, you or what you own?
And which would cost you more if it were gone?
The niggard pays, the miser loses.
The least ashamed of men goes back if he chooses:
He knows both ways, he starts again.

## Chapter 45

大成若缺
Great achievement seems incomplete,

其用不弊
But its usefulness is not impaired.

大盈若冲
Great fullness is like a cup or bowl,

其用不穷
Its usefulness is not exhausted.

大直若屈
Great straightness seems bent.

大巧若拙
Great skillfulness seems clumsy.

大辩若讷
Great debaters seem slow of speech.

躁胜寒
Restlessness conquers cold.

静胜热
Stillness conquers heat.

清静为天下正
Purity and clarity along with stillness makes the world proper and correct.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
True perfection seems imperfect, yet it is perfectly itself.
True fullness seems empty, yet it is fully present.
True straightness seems crooked.
True wisdom seems foolish.
True art seems artless.
The Master allows things to happen.
She shapes events as they come.
She steps out of the way and lets the Tao speak for itself.

### Witter Bynner Translation
A man's work, however finished it seem, continues as long as he live;
A man, however perfect he seem, is needed as long as he live:
As long as truth appears falsity, the seer a fool, the prophet a dumb lout,
If you want to keep warm keep stirring about,
Keep still if you want to keep cool,
And in all the world one day no doubt your way shall be the rule.

## Chapter 46

天下有道
When the world possesses Dao,

却走马以粪
Riding horses are nonetheless used for manure.

天下无道
When the world is without Dao,

戎马生于郊
War-horses are bred in the countryside.

罪莫大于可欲
There is no fault greater than the capacity for desire.

祸莫大于不知足
There is no misfortune greater than not knowing when you have enough.

咎莫大于欲得
There is no error greater than desire for gain.

故知足之足常足矣
Therefore: knowing the sufficiency of having enough, there is always enough!

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
When a country is in harmony with the Tao, the factories make trucks and tractors.
When a country goes counter to the Tao, warheads are stockpiled outside the cities.
There is no greater illusion than fear, no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself, no greater misfortune than having an enemy.
Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe.

### Witter Bynner Translation
In a land where the way of life is understood race-horses are led back to serve the field;
In a land where the way of life is not understood war-horses are bred on the autumn yield.
Owning is the entanglement, wanting is the bewilderment, taking is the presentiment:
Only he who contains content remains content.

## Chapter 47

不出户
You do not have to go out the door

以知天下
In order to to know the world.

不窥牖
You do not have to look out the window

以知天道
In order to to know the Way of heaven.

其出弥远
The farther you go out,

其知弥少
You know even less.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

不行而知
Does not travel, yet knows.

不见而名
Does not display himself, yet has a reputation.

不为而成
Does not act, yet accomplishes.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Without opening your door, you can open your heart to the world.
Without looking out your window, you can see the essence of the Tao.
The more you know, the less you understand.
The Master arrives without leaving, sees the light without looking, achieves without doing a thing.

### Witter Bynner Translation
There is no need to run outside for better seeing,
Nor to peer from a window. Rather abide at the center of your being;
For the more you leave it, the less you learn.
Search your heart and see if he is wise who takes each turn:
The way to do is to be.

## Chapter 48

为学者日益
The actions of those who learn daily increase.

为道者日损
The actions of those who Dao daily decrease.

损之又损
Decreasing and again decreasing,

以至于无为
In order to arrive at non-action.

无为而无不为
Use non-action, and nothing is left undone.

取天下常以无事
To take hold of the world, always use non-interference.

及其有事
When you are compelled to interfere,

不足以取天下
Then you are not qualified to take hold of the world.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
In the pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added.
In the practice of the Tao, every day something is dropped.
Less and less do you need to force things, until finally you arrive at non-action.
When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
True mastery can be gained by letting things go their own way.
It can't be gained by interfering.

### Witter Bynner Translation
A man anxious for knowledge adds more to himself every minute;
A man acquiring life loses himself in it, has less and less to bear in mind,
Less and less to do, because life, he finds, is well inclined, including himself too.
Often a man sways the world like a wind but not by deed;
And if there appear to you to be need of motion to sway it, it has left you behind.

## Chapter 49

圣人无常心
The sage does not have a constant heart/mind,

以百姓心为心
Thus the 100 families' heart/minds become his heart/mind.

善者吾善之
He who is virtuous, I am virtuous to him.

不善者吾亦善之
He who is not virtuous, I am also virtuous to him.

德善
Because De is virtue.

信者吾信之
He who is honest, I am honest with him.

不信者吾亦信之
He who is not honest, I am also honest with him.

德信
Because De is honesty.

圣人在天下歙歙
The sage lives in the world, gathering it all in.

焉为天下浑其心
And so he serves the world, merging with their heart/minds.

百姓皆注其耳目
The 100 families all pay attention to their ears and eyes,

圣人皆孩之
And the sage treats them all like his children.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Master has no mind of her own.
She works with the mind of the people.
She is good to people who are good.
She is also good to people who aren't good.
This is true goodness.
She trusts people who are trustworthy.
She also trusts people who aren't trustworthy.
This is true trust.
The Master's mind is like space.
People don't understand her.
They look to her and wait.
She treats them like her own children.

### Witter Bynner Translation
A sound man's heart is not shut within itself but is open to other people's hearts:
I find good people good, and I find bad people good if I am good enough;
I trust men of their word, and I trust liars if I am true enough;
I feel the heart-heats of others above my own
If I am enough of a father, enough of a son.

## Chapter 50

出生入死
Between coming out into life and entering death,

生之徒十有三
Followers of life are 3 in 10.

死之徒十有三
Followers of death are 3 in 10.

人之生动之死地
People whose lives are merely moving them towards the place of death

亦十有三
Are also 3 in 10.

夫何故
Now: what is the reason?

以其生生之厚
Because they live life for its substance.

盖闻善摄生者
But I have heard that he who is skilled at taking in life

陵行不遇兕虎
Can travel the mountains and does not meet rhino or tiger,

入军不被甲兵
Can enter a battle not wearing armor or weapons.

兕无所投其角
The rhino has no place to thrust its horns,

虎无所措其爪
The tiger has no place to use its claws,

兵无所容其刃
The weapon has no place to allow its blade.

夫何故
Now: what is the reason?

以其无死地
Because for him there is no place of death.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Master gives himself up to whatever the moment brings.
He knows that he is going to die, and he has nothing left to hold on to: no illusions in his mind, no resistances in his body.
He doesn't think about his actions; they flow from the core of his being.
He holds nothing back from life; therefore he is ready for death, as a man is ready for sleep after a good day's work.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Death might appear to be the issue of life,
Since for every three out of ten being born three out of ten are dying.
Then why should another three out of ten continue breeding death?
By use of sheer madness to multiply.
But there is one out of ten, they say, so sure of life
That tiger and wild bull keep clear of his inland path.
Weapons turn from him on the battle-field,
No bull-horn could tell where to gore him,
No tiger-claw where to tear him,
No weapon where to enter him.
And why?
Because he has no death to die.

## Chapter 51

道生之
Dao creates them,

德畜之
De raises them,

物形之
Things shape them,

势成之
Circumstances complete them.

是以万物
Thus among the ten thousand creatures,

莫不尊道而贵德
There are none who do not respect Dao and honor De.

道之尊
Respect of Dao,

德之贵
Honor of De –

夫莫之命
Now: there is no one who commands this,

而常自然
Yet it is always naturally so.

故道生之德畜之
Therefore: Dao creates them, De raises them.

长之育之
Leads them, nourishes them,

亭之毒之
Shelters them, heals them,

养之覆之
Supports them, protects them.

生而不有
Creating but not possessing,

为而不恶
Acting but not concerned with the results,

长而不宰
Leading yet not governing –

是谓玄德
This is called deep and mysterious De.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Every being in the universe is an expression of the Tao.
It springs into existence, unconscious, perfect, free, takes on a physical body, lets circumstances complete it.
That is why every being spontaneously honors the Tao.
The Tao gives birth to all beings, nourishes them, maintains them, cares for them, comforts them, protects them, takes them back to itself, creating without possessing, acting without expecting, guiding without interfering.
That is why love of the Tao is in the very nature of things.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Existence having born them and fitness bred them,
While matter varied their forms and breath empowered them,
All created things render, to the existence and fitness they depend on, an obedience
Not commanded but of course.
And since this is the way existence bears issue and fitness raises, attends, shelters, feeds and protects,
Do you likewise be parent, not possessor, attendant, not master,
Be concerned not with obedience but with benefit, and you are at the core of living.

## Chapter 52

天下有始
The world had a beginning,

以为天下母
Which can be considered the mother of the world.

既得其母
Once you have realized its mother,

以知其子
You thus know her children.

既知其子
Once you know her children,

复守其母
Return to and maintain their mother.

没身不殆
When the self disappears, there can be no danger.

塞其兑闭其门
Block your senses, close your gateway –

终身不勤
All your life you will not struggle.

开其兑济其事
Open your senses, be successful in your duties –

终身不救
All your life you will not have relief.

见小曰明
Seeing the insignificant speaks of insight.

守柔曰强
Maintaining softness speaks of strength.

用其光复归其明
Use your brightness to return to your insight.

无遗身殃
Do not lose your self in misfortune.

是谓习常
This is called practicing the ever-constant.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
In the beginning was the Tao.
All things issue from it; all things return to it.
To find the origin, trace back the manifestations.
When you recognize the children and find the mother, you will be free of sorrow.
If you close your mind in judgments and traffic with desires, your heart will be troubled.
If you keep your mind from judging and aren't led by the senses, your heart will find peace.
Seeing into darkness is clarity.
Knowing how to yield is strength.
Use your own light and return to the source of light.
This is called practicing eternity.

### Witter Bynner Translation
The source of life is as a mother.
Be fond of both mother and children but know the mother dearer and you outlive death.
Curb your tongue and senses and you are beyond trouble,
Let them loose and you are beyond help.
Discover that nothing is too small for clear vision, too insignificant for tender strength—
Use outlook and insight, use them both and you are immune:
For you have witnessed eternity.

## Chapter 53

使我介然有知
If I correctly use the tiniest bit of knowledge that I possess

行于大道
While travelling on the great Way,

唯迤是畏
It is only walking off the path that I need to fear.

大道甚夷
The great Way is extremely even,

而民好径
But the citizens are fond of side paths.

朝甚除
Although the royal court is very well-kept,

田甚芜
The fields are very overgrown with weeds,

仓甚虚
The granaries are very empty.

服文彩
While at the court they wear refined multicolored silks,

带利剑
Carry sharp swords,

厌饮食
Stuff themselves with drink and food,

财货有余
And have an excess of wealth and goods.

是谓盗夸
This is called robbery and extravagance,

非道也哉
Not Dao, indeed!!

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths.
Be aware when things are out of balance.
Stay centered within the Tao.
When rich speculators prosper while farmers lose their land; when government officials spend money on weapons instead of cures; when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible while the poor have nowhere to turn — all this is robbery and chaos.
It is not in keeping with the Tao.

### Witter Bynner Translation
If I had any learning of a highway wide and fit, would I lose it at each turning?
Yet look at people spurning natural use of it!
See how fine the palaces and see how poor the farms,
How bare the peasants' granaries while gentry wear embroideries hiding sharpened arms,
And the more they have the more they seize,
How can there be such men as these who never hunger, never thirst,
Yet eat and drink until they burst!
There are other brigands, but these are the worst of all the highway's harms.

## Chapter 54

善建者不拔
That which is well established is not uprooted.

善抱者不脱
That which is well embraced is not abandoned.

子孙以祭祀不辍
Thus children and grandchildren offer sacrifices, and so sacrifices do not stop.

修之于身其德乃真
Cultivate it in the self – your De will then be true and real.

修之于家其德乃余
Cultivate it in the family – its De will then be more than enough.

修之于乡其德乃长
Cultivate it in the village – its De will then last forever.

修之于国其德乃丰
Cultivate it in the nation – its De will then be abundant.

修之于天下其德乃普
Cultivate it in the world – its De will then be everywhere.

故以身观身
Therefore: use your self to contemplate the self.

以家观家
Use your family to contemplate the family.

以乡观乡
Use your village to contemplate the village.

以国观国
Use your nation to contemplate the nation.

以天下观天下
Use the world to contemplate the world.

吾何以知天下然哉
How do I thus know the world is like this?

以此
By means of this.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Whoever is planted in the Tao will not be rooted up.
Whoever embraces the Tao will not slip away.
Her name will be held in honor from generation to generation.
Let the Tao be present in your life and you will become genuine.
Let it be present in your family and your family will flourish.
Let it be present in your country and your country will be an example to all countries in the world.
Let it be present in the universe and the universe will sing.
How do I know this is true?
By looking inside myself.

### Witter Bynner Translation
'Since true foundation cannot fail but holds as good as new,
Many a worshipful son shall hail a father who lived true.'
Realized in one man, fitness has its rise;
Realized in a family, fitness multiplies;
Realized in a village, fitness gathers weight;
Realized in a country, fitness becomes great;
Realized in the world, fitness fills the skies.
And thus the fitness of one man you find in the family he began,
You find in the village that accrued,
You find in the country that ensued,
You find in the world's whole multitude.
How do I know this integrity?
Because it could all begin in me.

## Chapter 55

含德之厚
He who embodies the substance of De

比于赤子
Can be compared to a newborn child:

蜂蠆虺蛇不螫
Wasps, scorpions, snakes, and serpents do not sting him,

猛兽不据
Fierce beasts do not seize him,

攫鸟不搏
Birds of prey do not claw him.

骨弱筋柔而握固
His bones are weak, his muscles are soft, yet his grasp is firm and strong.

未知牝牡之合而脧作
He has not yet known the union of female and male, yet his penis rises.

精之至也
He has the utmost essence, indeed!

终日号而不嗄
He cries the entire day yet does not get hoarse.

和之至也
He has the utmost harmony, indeed!

知和曰常
Knowing harmony speaks of the ever-constant.

知常曰明
Knowing the ever-constant speaks of insight.

益生曰祥
Benefitting life speaks of good fortune.

心使气曰强
Heart/mind making Qi speaks of strength.

物壮则老
When creatures are robust but old,

谓之不道
We call them "not Dao".

不道早已
That which is "not Dao" has an early finish.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
He who is in harmony with the Tao is like a newborn child.
Its bones are soft, its muscles are weak, but its grip is powerful.
It doesn't know about the union of male and female, yet its penis can stand erect, so intense is its vital power.
It can scream its head off all day, yet it never becomes hoarse, so complete is its harmony.
The Master's power is like this.
He lets all things come and go effortlessly, without desire.
He never expects results; thus he is never disappointed.
He is never disappointed; thus his spirit never grows old.

### Witter Bynner Translation
He whom life fulfills, though he remains a child, is immune to the poisonous sting
Of insects, to the ravening of wild beasts or to vultures' bills.
He needs no more bone or muscle than a baby's for sure hold.
Without thought of joined organs, he is gender which grows firm, unfaltering.
Though his voice should cry out at full pitch all day, it would not rasp
but would stay tender through the perfect balancing
Of a man at endless ease with everything because of the true life that he has led.
To try for more than this bodes ill.
It is said, 'there's a way where there's a will;'
But let life ripen and then fall.
Will is not the way at all:
Deny the way of life and you are dead.

## Chapter 56

知者不言
He who knows does not speak;

言者不知
He who speaks does not know.

塞其兑闭其门
Block your senses, close your gateway.

挫其锐
Blunt your sharpness,

解其纷
Loosen your tangles,

和其光
Soften your brightness,

同其尘
Be the same as the dust of the world.

是谓玄同
This is called a deep and mysterious sameness.

故不可得而亲
Therefore: you can not gain it and be friendly,

不可得而疏
Can not gain it and be unfriendly,

不可得而利
Can not gain it and benefit,

不可得而害
Can not gain it and cause harm,

不可得而贵
Can not gain it and have high rank,

不可得而贱
Can not gain it and be lowly.

故为天下贵
Therefore you become valuable to the world.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Those who know don't talk.
Those who talk don't know.
Close your mouth, block off your senses, blunt your sharpness, untie your knots, soften your glare, settle your dust.
This is the primal identity.
Be like the Tao.
It can't be approached or withdrawn from, benefited or harmed, honored or brought into disgrace.
It gives itself up continually.
That is why it endures.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Those who know do not tell, those who tell do not know.
Not to set the tongue loose but to curb it,
Not to have edges that catch but to remain untangled, unblinded, unconfused,
Is to find balance,
And he who holds balance beyond sway of love or hate,
Beyond reach of profit or loss, beyond care of praise or blame,
Has attained the highest post in the world.

## Chapter 57

以正治国
Use honesty and justness when governing a nation.

以奇用兵
Use strange and unusual tactics when commanding troops.

以无事取天下
Use non-interference to take hold of the world.

吾何以知其然哉
How do I thus know it is like this?

以此
By means of this:

天下多忌讳
The world has many prohibitions and taboos,

而民弥贫
And the citizens become even poorer.

民多利器
The citizens have many sharp tools,

而国家滋昏
And the nation and the families grow in confusion.

人多知巧
The people have too much knowledge and cleverness,

而奇物滋起
And strange things begin to increase.

法物滋彰
Matters of law are increasingly proclaimed,

盗贼多有
And more thieves and bandits exist.

故圣人云
Therefore: the sage says –

我无为而民自化
I use non-action, and the citizens naturally transform.

我好静而民自正
I cherish stillness, and the citizens naturally become honest and just.

我无事而民自富
I use non-interference, and the citizens naturally become wealthy.

我无欲而民自朴
I am without-desire, and the citizens naturally return to the state of the uncarved block.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
If you want to be a great leader, you must learn to follow the Tao.
Stop trying to control.
Let go of fixed plans and concepts, and the world will govern itself.
The more prohibitions you have, the less virtuous people will be.
The more weapons you have, the less secure people will be.
The more subsidies you have, the less self-reliant people will be.
Therefore the Master says: I let go of the law, and people become honest.
I let go of economics, and people become prosperous.
I let go of religion, and people become serene.
I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good becomes common as grass.

### Witter Bynner Translation
A realm is governed by ordinary acts, a battle is governed by extraordinary acts;
The world is governed by no acts at all.
And how do I know?
This is how I know.
Act after act prohibits everything but poverty,
Weapon after weapon conquers everything but chaos,
Business after business provides a craze of waste,
Law after law breeds a multitude of thieves.
Therefore a sensible man says:
If I keep from meddling with people, they take care of themselves,
If I keep from commanding people, they behave themselves,
If I keep from preaching at people, they improve themselves,
If I keep from imposing on people, they become themselves.

## Chapter 58

其政闷闷
If their government is very restrained,

其民淳淳
Its citizens will be very genuine and honest.

其政察察
If their government is very observant and alert,

其民缺缺
Its citizens will be very lacking and deficient.

祸兮福之所倚
Misfortune! is that which good fortune leans on.

福兮祸之所伏
Good fortune! is that which misfortune lies on.

孰知其极
Who knows their limits?

其无正
They are not honest and just.

正复为奇
Honesty and justness returns, becoming strange and unusual.

善复为妖
Virtue returns, becoming weird and strange.

人之迷
The confusion of the people –

其日固久
Its days have indeed been everlasting.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

方而不割
Is honest and does not divide,

廉而不刿
Is honorable and does not injure,

直而不肆
Is straightforward and does not indulge in excess,

光而不耀
Is bright but does not dazzle.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
If a country is governed with tolerance, the people are comfortable and honest.
If a country is governed with repression, the people are depressed and crafty.
When the will to power is in charge, the higher the ideals, the lower the results.
Try to make people happy, and you lay the groundwork for misery.
Try to make people moral, and you lay the groundwork for vice.
Thus the Master is content to serve as an example and not to impose her will.
She is pointed, but doesn't pierce.
Straightforward, but supple.
Radiant, but easy on the eyes.

### Witter Bynner Translation
The less a leader does and says the happier his people,
The more a leader struts and brags the sorrier his people.
Often what appears to be unhappiness is happiness
And what appears to be happiness is unhappiness.
Who can see what leads to what when happiness appears and yet is not,
When what should be is nothing but a mask disguising what should not be?
Who can but ask an end to such a stupid plot!
Therefore a sound man shall so square the circle and circle the square as not to injure, not to impede:
The glow of his life shall not daze, it shall lead.

## Chapter 59

治人事天
When governing people or doing heaven's duties,

莫若啬
It is better to be sparing.

夫唯啬
Now: only when you can be sparing,

是谓早服
This is called early acceptance.

早服谓之重积德
Early acceptance is called doubling your accumulation of De.

重积德
With a double accumulation of De,

则无不克
Then everything can be overcome.

无不克
When everything can be overcome,

则莫知其极
Then no one knows your limits.

莫知其极
When no one knows your limits,

可以有国
You can possess the nation.

有国之母
Possessing the mother of the nation,

可以长久
You can forever endure.

是谓深根固柢
This is called having a deep source and a firm foundation,

长生久视之道
The Way of long life and enduring sight.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
For governing a country well there is nothing better than moderation.
The mark of a moderate man is freedom from his own ideas.
Tolerant like the sky, all-pervading like sunlight, firm like a mountain, supple like a tree in the wind, he has no destination in view and makes use of anything life happens to bring his way.
Nothing is impossible for him.
Because he has let go, he can care for the people's welfare as a mother cares for her child.

### Witter Bynner Translation
To lead men and serve heaven, weigh the worth of the one source:
Use the single force which doubles the strength of the strong
By enabling man to go right, disabling him to go wrong,
Be so charged with the nature of life that you give your people birth,
That you mother your land, are the fit and ever-living root of it:
The seeing root, whose eye is infinite.

## Chapter 60

治大国若烹小鲜
Governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish.

以道莅天下
Because Dao is present in the world,

其鬼不神
Its ghosts do not have spirit.

非其鬼不神
Not that its ghosts do not have any spirit,

其神不伤人
But their spirit does not injure people.

非其神不伤人
Not only does their spirit not injure people,

圣人亦不伤人
The sage also does not injure people.

夫两不相伤
Now: since these two do not injure each other,

故德交归焉
Therefore their De merges and returns!

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Governing a large country is like frying a small fish.
You spoil it with too much poking.
Center your country in the Tao and evil will have no power.
Not that it isn't there, but you'll be able to step out of its way.
Give evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Handle a large kingdom with as gentle a touch as if you were cooking small fish.
If you manage people by letting them alone, ghosts of the dead shall not haunt you.
Not that there are no ghosts but that their influence becomes propitious
In the sound existence of a living man:
There is no difference between the quick and the dead,
They are one channel of vitality.

## Chapter 61

大国者下流
A great nation is like the lowest places water can flow –

天下之交
The merging place of the world,

天下之牝
The female of the world.

牝常以静胜牡
The female always uses stillness to conquer the male.

以静为下
By using stillness, she becomes lower-than.

故大国以下小国
Therefore: if a great nation is lower-than a small nation,

则取小国
Then it takes hold of the small nation.

小国以下大国
If a small nation is lower-than a great nation,

则取于大国
Then it is taken hold of by the great nation.

故或下以取
Therefore: sometimes one nation is lower-than in order to take hold of,

或下而取
Sometimes one nation is lower-than and then it is taken hold of.

大国不过欲兼畜人
A great nation merely desires to combine livestock and people,

小国不过欲入事人
A small nation merely desires to get work for its people.

夫两者各得其所欲
Now: for both nations to each get that which is their desire,

大者宜为下
It is proper for the great nation to be lower-than.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
When a country obtains great power, it becomes like the sea: all streams run downward into it.
The more powerful it grows, the greater the need for humility.
Humility means trusting the Tao, thus never needing to be defensive.
A great nation is like a great man: When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.
Having realized it, he admits it.
Having admitted it, he corrects it.
He considers those who point out his faults as his most benevolent teachers.
He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he himself casts.
If a nation is centered in the Tao, if it nourishes its own people and doesn't meddle in the affairs of others, it will be a light to all nations in the world.

### Witter Bynner Translation
A large country is the low level of interflowing rivers.
It draws people to the sea-end of a valley as the female draws the male,
Receives it into absorbing depth because depth always absorbs.
And so a large country, inasfar as it is deeper than a small country, absorbs the small—
Or a small country, inasfar as it is deeper than a large country, absorbs the large.
Some countries consciously seek depth into which to draw others.
Some countries naturally have depth into which to draw others:
A large country needs to admit, a small country needs to emit,
And so each country can naturally have what it needs if the large country submit.

## Chapter 62

道者万物之奥
That which Daos is the obscure mystery of the ten thousand creatures.

善人之宝
This is the treasure of a virtuous person,

不善人之所保
And that which is the protection of a person who is not virtuous.

美言可以市
Beautiful speech can be used in the market,

尊行可以加人
Respectful behavior can benefit people.

人之不善
People who are not virtuous,

何弃之有
Why abandon them?

故立天子
Therefore: when inaugurating the son of heaven,

置三公
Or installing the three nobles –

虽有拱璧以先驷马
Even if you possessed jade disks drawn by a team of four horses,

不如坐进此道
That is not as good as sitting and offering this Way.

古之所以贵此道者何
What was the ancients' reason that they valued this Way?

不曰
Did they not say:

以求得
Seek in order to obtain,

有罪以免邪
Have faults in order to be forgiven?

故为天下贵
Therefore Dao becomes valuable to the world.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
The Tao is the center of the universe, the good man's treasure, the bad man's refuge.
Honors can be bought with fine words, respect can be won with good deeds; but the Tao is beyond all value, and no one can achieve it.
Thus, when a new leader is chosen, don't offer to help him with your wealth or your expertise.
Offer instead to teach him about the Tao.
Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao?
Because, being one with the Tao, when you seek, you find; and when you make a mistake, you are forgiven.
That is why everybody loves it.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Existence is sanctuary:
It is a good man's purse, it is also a bad man's keep.
Clever performances come dear or cheap, goodness comes free;
And how shall a man who acts better deny a man who acts worse this right to be.
Rather, when an emperor is crowned, let the three
Ministers whom he appoints to receive for him fine horses and gifts of jade
Receive for him also the motionless gift of integrity,
The gift prized as highest by those ancients who said,
'Only pursue an offender to show him the way.'
What men in all the world could have more wealth than they?

## Chapter 63

为无为
Act with non-action.

事无事
Handle duties with non-interference.

味无味
Taste that which is without-flavor.

大小多少
Greatness is insignificant, too much is less.

报怨以德
Repay animosity with De.

图难于其易
Plan for the difficult while it is easy.

为大于其细
Act on the great while it is tiny.

天下难事必作于易
In the world, difficult duties certainly start while easy.

天下大事必作于细
In the world, great duties certainly start while tiny.

是以圣人终不为大
Thus the sage in the end does not act great,

故能成其大
Therefore he can achieve his greatness.

夫轻诺必寡信
Men who make promises lightly, certainly few will trust.

多易必多难
Men who expect most duties to be easy will certainly have many difficulties.

是以圣人犹难之
Thus the sage plans for things to be difficult,

故终无难矣
Therefore in the end he is without difficulty!

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
Act without doing; work without effort.
Think of the small as large and the few as many.
Confront the difficult while it is still easy; accomplish the great task by a series of small acts.
The Master never reaches for the great; thus she achieves greatness.
When she runs into a difficulty, she stops and gives herself to it.
She doesn't cling to her own comfort; thus problems are no problem for her.

### Witter Bynner Translation
Men knowing the way of life do without acting, effect without enforcing, taste without consuming;
'Through the many they find the few, through the humble the great;'
They 'respect their foes,' they 'face the simple fact before it becomes involved,
Solve the small problem before it becomes big.'
The most involved fact in the world could have been faced when it was simple,
The biggest problem in the world could have been solved when it was small.
The simple fact that he finds no problem big is a sane man's prime achievement.
If you say yes too quickly you may have to say no,
If you think things are done too easily you may find them hard to do:
If you face trouble sanely it cannot trouble you.

## Chapter 64

其安易持
What is peaceful is easy to hold.

其未兆易谋
What has not yet been revealed is easy to plan for.

其脆易泮
What is brittle is easy to shatter.

其微易散
What is minute is easy to scatter.

为之于未有
Act on it while it does not yet exist.

治之于未乱
Govern them while they are not yet confused.

合抱之木生于毫末
A tree too big to embrace is created from the tiniest shoot.

九层之台起于累土
A terrace of nine stories rises from a pile of dirt.

千里之行始于足下
A journey of a thousand miles begins from under the feet.

为者败之
He who acts, ruins it.

执者失之
He who grasps, loses it.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

无为故无败
Does not act, therefore he does not ruin.

无执故无失
Does not grasp, therefore he does not lose.

民之从事常于几成而败之
Citizens are always on the verge of achieving their undertakings, yet they ruin them.

慎终如始
Be as careful in the end as if it was the beginning,

则无败事
Then you will not ruin your affairs.

是以圣人
Thus the sage:

欲不欲
Desires to not desire,

不贵难得之货
Does not value rare goods,

学不学
Learns to not learn.

复众人之所过
He returns to that which everyone else has passed over,

以辅万物之自然
Thus helping the ten thousand creatures to be naturally so,

而不敢为
Yet not daring to act.

### Stephen Mitchell Translation
What is rooted is easy to nourish.
What is recent is easy to correct.
What is brittle is easy to break.
What is small is easy to scatter.
Prevent trouble before it arises.
Put things in order before they exist.
The giant pine tree grows from a tiny sprout.
The journey of a thousand miles starts from beneath your feet.
Rushing into action, you fail.
Trying to grasp things, you lose them.
Forcing a project to completion, you ruin what was almost ripe.
Therefore the Master takes action by letting things take their course.
