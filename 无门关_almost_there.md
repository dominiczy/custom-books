## Mumon's Preface

### Comment

佛语心为宗、无门为法门。
Buddhism makes mind its foundation and no-gate its gate.
既是无门、且作么生透。
Now, how do you pass through this no-gate?
岂不见道、从门入者不是家珍、从缘得者始终成坏。
It is said that things coming in through the gate can never be your own treasures.
What is gained from external circumstances will perish in the end.
恁么说话、大似无风起浪好肉抉疮。
However, such a saying is already raising waves when there is no wind. It is
cutting unblemished skin.
恁: nèn, such, so (classical) (Alternative: 这样, 那么)
抉: jué, to pick out, to gouge out (Alternative: 挖出, 挑出)
疮: chuāng, sore, ulcer, wound (Alternative: 伤口, 溃疡)
何况滞言句觅解会。 掉棒打月、隔靴爬痒、有甚交涉。
As for those who try to understand through other people's words, they are striking
at the moon with a stick; scratching a shoe, whereas it is the foot that itches. What
concern have they with the truth?

慧开、绍定戊子夏、首众于东嘉龙翔。因纳子请益、遂将古人公案作敲门瓦子、随机引导学者。
In the summer of the first year of Jõtei, Ekai was in Ryûshõ Temple and as head
monk worked with the monks, using the cases of the ancient masters as brickbats
to batter the gate and lead them on according to their respective capacities.
戊: wù, 5th of the 10 Heavenly Stems (No direct HSK equivalent for this specific calendar term, but refers to a year in the sexagenary cycle)
竟尔抄录、不觉成集。初不以前后叙列、共成四十八则。
The text was written down not according to any scheme, but just to make a
collection of forty-eight cases.
尔: ěr, thus, so (classical) (Alternative: 这样, 如此)
通曰无门关。
It is called Mumonkan, "The Gateless Gate."

若是箇汉、不顾危亡单刀直入。
A man of determination will unflinchingly push his way straight forward,
regardless of all dangers.
箇: gè, (variant of 个) (Alternative: 个)
八臂那吒、搁他不在。
Then even the eight-armed Nata cannot hinder him.
吒: zhà, to scold, to shout (often used in names like Nezha) (Alternative: 喝斥, 喊叫)
纵使西天四七、东土二三、只得望风乞命。
Even the four sevens of the West and the two threes of the East would beg for their
lives.
设或踌躇、也似隔窗看马骑、贬得眼来、早已蹉过。
If one has no determination, then it will be like catching a glimpse of a horse
galloping past the window: in the twinkling of an eye it will be gone.
贬: biǎn, to demote, to disparage (Alternative: 批评, 降职)
蹉: cuō, to miss, to slip (Alternative: 错过, 耽误)

### Verse 颂曰

大道无门
The Great Way is gateless,
千差有路
Approached in a thousand ways.
透得此关
Once past this checkpoint
乾坤独步
You stride through the universe.
乾: qián, heaven, male principle (in Yijing/I Ching) (Alternative: 天)
坤: kūn, earth, female principle (in Yijing/I Ching) (Alternative: 地)

## Case 1 Jõshû's "Mu" 一 趙州狗子

### Comment

无门曰、参禅须透祖师关、妙悟要穷心路绝。
In order to master Zen, you must pass the barrier of the patriarchs. To attain this
subtle realization, you must completely cut off the way of thinking.
祖关不透心路不绝、尽是依草附木精灵。
If you do not pass the barrier, and do not cut off the way of thinking, then you will
be like a ghost clinging to the bushes and weeds.
且道、如何是祖师关。
Now, I want to ask you, what is the barrier of the patriarchs?
只者一个无字、乃宗门一关也。
Why, it is this single word "Mu." That is the front gate to Zen.
遂目之曰禅宗无门关。
Therefore it is called the "Mumonkan of Zen."
透得过者、非但亲见赵州、便可与历代祖师把手共行、眉毛厮结同一眼见、
If you pass through it, you will not only see Jõshû face to face, but you will also go
hand in hand with the successive patriarchs, entangling your eyebrows with theirs,
seeing with the same eyes, hearing with the same ears.
厮: sī, mutually, together (classical) (Alternative: 互相, 一起)
同一耳闻。
Isn't that a delightful prospect?
岂不庆快。
Wouldn't you like to pass this barrier?
莫有要透关底么。
Arouse your entire body with its three hundred and sixty bones and joints and its
eighty-four thousand pores of the skin; summon up a spirit of great doubt and
concentrate on this word "Mu."
将三百六十骨节、八万四千毫窍、通身起箇疑团参箇无字。
Carry it continuously day and night. Do not form a nihilistic conception of
vacancy, or a relative conception of "has" or "has not."
窍: qiào, opening, hole, key (Alternative: 孔, 关键)
昼夜提撕、莫作虚无会、莫作有无会。
It will be just as if you swallow a red-hot iron ball, which you cannot spit out even
if you try.
撕: sī, to tear (HSK5). Here it means to lift, to raise. (Alternative: 提起, 举起)
如吞了箇热铁丸相似、吐又吐不出。
All the illusory ideas and delusive thoughts accumulated up to the present will be
exterminated, and when the time comes, internal and external will be
spontaneously united. You will know this, but for yourself only, like a dumb man
who has had a dream.
荡尽从前恶知恶觉、久久纯熟自然内外打成一片、如哑子得梦、只许自知。
蓦然打发、惊天动地。
Then all of a sudden an explosive conversion will occur, and you will astonish the
heavens and shake the earth.

如夺得关将军大刀入手、逢佛杀佛、逢祖杀祖、于生死岸头得大自在、向六道四生中游戏三昧。
It will be as if you snatch away the great sword of the valiant general Kan'u and
hold it in your hand. When you meet the Buddha, you kill him; when you meet the
patriarchs, you kill them. On the brink of life and death, you command perfect

### Comment

自由; among the sixfold worlds and four modes of existence, you enjoy a merry
and playful samadhi.

且作么生提撕。
Now, I want to ask you again, "How will you carry it out?"
尽平生气力举箇无字。
Employ every ounce of your energy to work on this "Mu."
若不间断、好似法烛一点便著。
If you hold on without interruption, behold: a single spark, and the holy candle is
lit!

### Verse 颂曰

狗子佛性
The dog, the Buddha Nature,
全提正令
The pronouncement, perfect and final.
才涉有无
Before you say it has or has not,
丧身失命
You are a dead man on the spot.

## Case 2 Hyakujõ's Fox 二 百丈野狐

### Comment

百丈和尚、凡参次、有一老人常随众听法。
When Hyakujõ Oshõ delivered a certain series of sermons, an old man always
followed the monks to the main hall and listened to him.
众人退、老人亦退。
When the monks left the hall, the old man would also leave.
忽一日不退。师遂问、面前立者复是何人。
One day, however, he remained behind, and Hyakujõ asked him, "Who are you,
standing here before me?"
老人云、诺。
The old man replied.
诺: nuò, to assent, to promise (Alternative: 答应, 同意)
某甲非人也。
"I am not a human being.
于过去迦叶佛时曾住此山。
In the old days of Kashyapa Buddha, I was a head monk, living here on this
mountain.
因学人问、大修行底人还落因果也无。
One day a student asked me, 'Does a man of enlightenment fall under the yoke of
causation or not?'
某甲对云、不落因果。
I answered, 'No, he does not.'
五百生堕野狐身。
Since then I have been doomed to undergo five hundred rebirths as a fox.
今请、和尚代一转语贵脱野狐。
I beg you now to give the turning word to release me from my life as a fox.
遂问、大修行底人、还落因果也无。
Tell me, does a man of enlightenment fall under the yoke of causation or not?"
师云、不昧因果。
Hyakujõ answered, "He does not ignore causation."
昧: mèi, dark, obscure, to conceal (Alternative: 模糊, 隐藏)
老人于言下大悟。
No sooner had the old man heard these words than he was enlightened.
作礼云、某甲、已脱野狐身住在山后。
Making his bows, he said, "I am emancipated from my life as a fox. I shall remain
on this mountain.
敢告和尚。 乞、依亡僧事例。
I have a favor to ask of you: would you please bury my body as that of a dead
monk."

师、令维那白槌告众、食后送亡僧。
Hyakujõ had the director of the monks strike with the gavel and inform everyone
that after the midday meal there would be a funeral service for a dead monk.
槌: chuí, hammer, mallet (Alternative: 锤子)
大众言议、一众皆安、涅槃堂又无人病。何故如是。
The monks wondered at this, saying, "Everyone is in good health; nobody is in the
sick ward. What does this mean?"
食后只见师领众至山后嵒下、以杖挑出一死野狐、乃依火葬。
After the meal Hyakujõ led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the
mountain and with his staff poked out the dead body of a fox and performed the
ceremony of cremation.
嵒: yán, cliff, rock (variant of 崖) (Alternative: 悬崖, 岩石)
师、至晚上堂、举前因缘。
That evening he ascended the rostrum and told the monks the whole story.
黄檗便问、古人错祗对一转语、堕五百生野狐身、转转不错合作箇甚么。
Õbaku thereupon asked him, "The old man gave the wrong answer and was
doomed to be a fox for five hundred rebirths. Now, suppose he had given the right
answer, what would have happened then?"
檗: bò, bark of a tree (used in names like 黄檗) (Alternative: 树皮)
祗: zhī, only, just (classical) (Alternative: 只, 仅仅)
师云、近前来与伊道。
Hyakujõ said, "You come here to me, and I will tell you."
黄檗遂近前、与师一掌。
Õbaku went up to Hyakujõ and boxed his ears.
师拍手笑云、将谓、胡须赤。 更有赤须胡。
Hyakujõ clapped his hands with a laugh and exclaimed, "I was thinking that the
barbarian had a red beard, but now I see before me the red-bearded barbarian
himself."
须: xū, beard (Alternative: 胡子)

### Mumon's Comment

无门曰、不落因果、为甚堕野狐。
Not falling under causation: how could this make the monk a fox?
不昧因果、为甚脱野狐。
Not ignoring causation: how could this make the old man emancipated?
若向者里著得一只眼、便知得前百丈赢得风流五百生。
If you come to understand this, you will realize how old Hyakujõ would have
enjoyed five hundred rebirths as a fox.

### Mumon's Verse 颂曰

不落不昧
Not falling, not ignoring:
两采一赛
Two faces of one die.
不昧不落
Not ignoring, not falling:
千错万错
A thousand errors, a million mistakes.

Hearing of this, Gutei cut off the boy's finger with a knife.
童子、负痛号哭而去。
The boy, screaming with pain, began to run away.
胝复召之。 童子回首。 胝却坚起指。
Gutei called to him, and when he turned around, Gutei raised his finger.
童子忽然领悟。
The boy suddenly became enlightened.

胝将顺世、谓众曰、吾得天龙一指头禅、一生受用不尽。
When Gutei was about to pass away, he said to his assembled monks, "I obtained
one-finger Zen from Tenryû and used it all my life but still did not exhaust it."
言讫示灭。
When he had finished saying this, he entered into eternal Nirvana.
讫: qì, finished, completed (Alternative: 完毕, 结束)

### Mumon's Comment

无门曰、倶胝并童子悟处、不在指头上。
The enlightenment of Gutei and of the boy does not depend on the finger.
若向者里见得、天龙同倶胝并童子兴自己一串穿却。
If you understand this, Tenryû, Gutei, the boy, and you yourself are all run through
with one skewer.

### Comment

或庵曰、西天胡子、因甚无髭。
Wakuan said, "Why has the Western Barbarian no beard?"
髭: zī, mustache, beard (Alternative: 胡子)

### Mumon's Comment

无门曰、参须实参、悟须实悟。
Study should be real study, enlightenment should be real enlightenment.
者箇胡子、直须亲见一回始得。
You should once meet this barbarian directly to be really intimate with him.
说亲见、早成两个。
But saying you are really intimate with him already divides you into two.

the question. If he does answer, he will lose his life.
正恁么时、作么生对。
What would you do in such a situation?"

### Mumon's Comment

无门曰、纵有悬河之辨、惣用不著。
Even if your eloquence flows like a river, it is of no avail.
惣: zǒng, all, total (variant of 总) (Alternative: 总, 全部)
说得一大藏教、亦用不著。
Though you can expound the whole of Buddhist literature, it is of no use.
若向者里对得著、活却从前死路头、死却从前活路头。
If you solve this problem, you will give life to the way that has been dead until this
moment and destroy the way that has been alive up to now.
其或未然、直待当来问弥勒。
Otherwise you must wait for Maitreya Buddha and ask him.

惟迦叶者破颜微笑。

The Buddha said, "I have the True Dharma Eye, the Marvelous Mind of Nirvana,
the True Form of the Formless, and the Subtle Dharma Gate, independent of words
and transmitted beyond doctrine. This I have entrusted to Mahakashyapa."

阎: yán, village gate, neighborhood (classical) (Alternative: 村口, 街坊)

If you say it cannot be transmitted, then why did the Buddha approve of
Mahakashyapa?

Holding out a flower,

perfect freedom.

However, I must remind you: the two hermits could also see through Jõshû.
若道二庵主有优劣、未具参学眼。
If you say there is anything to choose between the two hermits, you have no eye of
realization.
若道无优劣、亦未具参学眼。
If you say there is no choice between the two, you have no eye of realization.

## Case 15 Tõzan's Sixty Blows 十五 洞山三顿

### Comment

云门、因洞山参次、门问曰、近离甚处。
Tõzan came to study with Unmon. Unmon asked, "Where are you from?"
山云、查渡。
"From Sato," Tõzan replied.
查: chá, to check, to investigate (HSK3). Here refers to a place name. (No direct HSK equivalent, refers to a proper name)
门曰、夏在甚处。
"Where were you during the summer?"
山云、湖南报慈。
"Well, I was at the monastery of Hõzu, south of the lake."
门曰、几时离彼。
"When did you leave there," Unmon asked.
山云、八月二十五。
"On August 25" was Tõzan's reply.
门曰、放汝三顿棒。
"I spare you sixty blows," Unmon said.
山至明日却上问讯。
The next day Tõzan came to Unmon and said, "Yesterday you said you spared me
sixty blows.
昨日蒙和尚放三顿棒。
I beg to ask you, where was I at fault?"
不知过在甚么处。
门曰、饭袋子、江西湖南便恁么去。
"Oh, you rice bag!" shouted Unmon. "What makes you wander about, now west of
the river, now south of the lake?"
恁: nèn, such, so (classical) (Alternative: 这样, 那么)
山于此大悟。
Tõzan thereupon came to a mighty enlightenment experience.

### Mumon's Comment

无门曰、云门、当时便与本分草料、使洞山别有生机一路、家门不致寂寥。
If Unmon had given Tõzan the true food of Zen and encouraged him to develop an
active Zen spirit, his school would not have declined as it did.
一夜在是非海里著到、直待天明再来、又与他注破。
Tõzan had an agonizing struggle through the whole night, lost in the sea of right
and wrong. He reached a complete impasse. After waiting for the dawn, he again
went to Unmon, and Unmon again made him a picture book of Zen.
洞山直下悟去、未是性燥。
Even though he was directly enlightened, Tõzan could not be called brilliant.
且问诸人、洞山三顿棒、合吃不合吃。
Now, I want to ask you, should Tõzan have been given sixty blows or not?
若道合吃、草木丛林皆合吃棒。
If you say yes, you admit that all the universe should be beaten.
若道不合吃、云门又成诳语。
If you say no, then you accuse Unmon of telling a lie.
诳: kuáng, to deceive, to lie (Alternative: 欺骗, 说谎)
向者里明得、方与洞山出一口气。
If you really understand the secret, you will be able to breathe out Zen spirit with
the very mouth of Tõzan.

因甚向钟声里披七条。
Why do you put on your seven-piece robe at the sound of the bell?"

### Mumon's Comment

无门曰、大凡参禅学道、切忌、随声遂色。
In studying Zen, you should not be swayed by sounds and forms.
纵使闻声悟道、见色明心也是寻常。
Even though you attain insight when hearing a voice or seeing a form, this is
simply the ordinary way of things.
殊不知、纳僧家、骑声盖色、头头上明、著著上妙。
Don't you know that the real Zen student commands sounds, controls forms, is
clear-sighted at every event and free on every occasion?
然虽如是。 且道、声来耳畔、耳往声边。
Granted you are free, just tell me: Does the sound come to the ear or does the ear
go to the sound?
畔: pàn, bank, side (Alternative: 旁边, 岸边)
直饶响寂双忘、到此如何话会。
If both sound and silence die away, at such a juncture how could you talk of Zen?
若将耳听应难会、眼处闻声方始亲。
While listening with you ear, you cannot tell. When hearing with your eye, you are
truly intimate.

### Mumon's Verse 颂曰

会则事同一家
With realization, things make one family;
不会万别千差
Without realization, things are separated in a thousand ways.
不会事同一家
Without realization, things make one family;
会则万别千差
With realization, things are separated in a thousand ways.

## Case 28 Ryûtan Blows Out the Candle 二十八 久响龙潭

### Comment

龙潭、因德山请益抵夜。
Tokusan asked Ryûtan about Zen far into the night.
潭云、夜深。
At last Ryûtan said, "The night is late.
子何不下去。
Why don't you retire?"
山遂珍重揭帘而出。 见外面黑却回云、外面黑。
Tokusan made his bows and lifted the blinds to withdraw, but he was met by
darkness. Turning back to Ryûtan, he said, "It is dark outside."
潭乃点纸烛度与。
Ryûtan lit a paper candle and handed it to him.
山拟接。潭便吹灭。
Tokusan was about to take it when Ryûtan blew it out.
山于此忽然有省。 便作礼。
At this, all of a sudden, Tokusan went through a deep experience and made bows.
潭云、子见箇甚么道理。
Ryûtan said, "What sort of realization do you have?"
山云、某甲从今日去不疑天下老和尚舌头也。
"From now on," said Tokusan, "I will not doubt the words of an old oshõ who is
renowned everywhere under the sun."
至明日、龙潭升堂云、可中有箇汉、牙如剑树、口似血盆。
The next day Ryûtan ascended the rostrum and said, "I see a fellow among you.
His fangs are like the sword tree. His mouth is like a blood bowl.
盆: pén, basin, pot (HSK3). Here means a blood-filled mouth. (Alternative: 容器, 碗)
一棒打不回头。
Strike him with a stick, and he won't turn his head to look at you.
他时异日、向孤峰顶上立君道在。
Someday or other, he will climb the highest of the peaks and establish our Way
there."
山遂取疏抄于法堂前、将一炬火提起云、穷诸玄辨、若一毫致于太虚、竭世
Tokusan brought his notes on the Diamond Sutra to the front of the hall, pointed to
them with a torch, and said, "Even though you have exhausted the abtruse
doctrines, it is like placing a hair in a vast space. Even though you have learned all
the secrets of the world, it is like a drop of water dripped on the great ocean."
炬: jù, torch (Alternative: 火把)
枢: shū, pivot, hinge (HSK6). Here means key, crucial point. (Alternative: 关键, 要害)
壑: hè, ravine, gully (Alternative: 山谷, 沟壑)
枢机似一滴投于巨壑。
将疏抄便烧。
And he burned all his notes.
于是礼辞。
Then, making bows, he took his leave of his teacher.

### Mumon's Comment

无门曰、德山未出关时、心愤愤、口□□、得得来南方要灭却教外别传之
Before Tokusan crossed the barrier from his native place, his mind burned and his
mouth uttered bitterness. He went soutward, intending to stamp out the doctrines of
special transmission outside the sutras.
旨。
及到州路上问婆子买点心。
When he reached the road to Reishû, he asked an old woman to let him have lunch
to "refresh the mind."
婆云、大德车子内是甚么文字。
"Your worship, what sort of literature do you carry in your pack?" the old woman
asked.
山云、金刚经疏抄。
"Commentaries on the Diamond Sutra," replied Tokusan.
婆云、只如经中道、过去心不可得、见在心不可得、未来心不可得。
The old woman said, "I hear it is said in that sutra, 'The past mind cannot be held,
the present mind cannot be held, the future mind cannot be held.'
大德、要点那个心。
Now, I would like to ask you, what mind are you going to have refreshed?"
德山被者一问、直得口似□檐。
At this question Tokusan was dumbfounded.
檐: yán, eaves (Alternative: 屋檐)
然虽如是、未肯向婆子句下死却。遂问婆子、近处有甚么宗师。
However, he did not remain inert under her words but asked, "Do you know of any
good teacher around here?"
婆云、五里外有龙潭和尚。
The old woman said, "Five miles from here you will find Ryûtan Oshõ."
及到龙潭纳尽败阙。
Coming to Ryûtan, Tokusan got the worst of it.
阙: què, deficiency, fault (Alternative: 缺点, 过失)
可谓是前言不应后语。
His former words were inconsistent with his later ones.
龙潭大似怜儿不觉丑。
As for Ryûtan, he seemed to have lost all sense of shame in his compassion toward
his son.
见他有些子火种、郎忙将恶水蓦头一浇浇杀。
Finding a bit of live coal in the other, enough to start a fire, he hurriedly poured on
muddy water to annihilate everything at once.
蓦: mò, suddenly, abruptly (Alternative: 突然, 猛然)
冷地看来、一场好笑。
A little cool reflection tells us it was all a farce.

### Mumon's Verse 颂曰

闻名不如见面
Hearing the name cannot surpass seeing the face;
见面不如闻名
Seeing the face cannot surpass hearing the name.
虽然救得鼻孔
He may have saved his nose,

But alas! he lost his eyes.

## Case 42 The Girl Comes out of Samadhi 四十二 女子出定

### Comment

世尊、昔、因文殊、至诸佛集处值诸佛各还本处。
Once, in the old days, in the time of the World-honored One, Manjusri went to the
assembly of the Buddhas and found that everyone had departed to his original
dwelling place.
惟有一女人近彼佛坐入于三昧。
Only a girl remained, sitting in samadhi close to the Buddha's throne.
文殊乃白佛、云何女人得近佛坐而我不得。
Manjusri asked Shakyamuni Buddha, "Why can the girl get near the Buddha's
throne, while I cannot?"
佛告文殊、汝但觉此女、令从三昧起、汝自问之。
Shakyamuni Buddha said, "Bring her out of her samadhi and ask her yourself."
文殊绕女人三□、鸣指一下、乃托至梵天尽其神力而不能出。
Manjusri walked around the girl three times, snapped his fingers once, took her to
the Brahma heaven, and exerted all his miraculous powers to bring her out of her
meditation, but in vain.
梵: fàn, Brahma (Buddhist term) (No direct HSK equivalent, refers to a Buddhist concept)

### Comment

I want to ask you: Manjusri is the teacher of the Seven Buddhas; why couldn't he

## Mumon's Postscript 后序

### Comment

从上佛祖垂示机缘、据款结案、初无剩语。
The sayings and doings of the Buddha and the patriarchs have been set down in
their original form.
揭翻脑盖、露出眼睛。
Nothing superfluous has been added by the author, who has taken the lid off his
head and exposed his eyeballs.
肯要诸人直下承当、不从他觅。
Your direct realization is demanded; it should not be sought through others.
若是通方上士。 才闻举著、便知落处。
If you are a man of realization, you will immediately grasp the point at the slightest
mention of it.
了无门户可入、亦无阶级可升。
There is no gate for you to go through; there are no stairs for you to ascend.
掉臂度关不问关吏。
You pass the checkpoint, squaring your shoulders, without asking permission of the
keeper.
吏: lì, official, clerk (Alternative: 官员, 职员)

岂不见玄沙道、无门解脱之门、无意道人之意。
Remember Gensha's saying, "No-gate is the gate of emancipation; no-meaning is
the meaning of the man of the Way."
又白云道、明明知道只是者箇、为甚么透不过。
And Hakuun says, "Clearly you know how to talk of it, but why can't you pass this
simple, specific thing?"

恁么说话、也是赤土□牛。
However, all this kind of talk is like making a mud pie with milk and butter.
恁: nèn, such, so (classical) (Alternative: 这样, 那么)
若透得无门关、早是钝置无门。
If you have passed the Mumonkan, you can make a fool of Mumon.
钝: dùn, dull, blunt (HSK6). Here means to make a fool of. (Alternative: 愚弄, 戏弄)
置: zhì, to place, to put (HSK4). Here means to make a fool of. (Alternative: 愚弄, 戏弄)
若透不得无门关、亦之辜负自己。
If not, you are betraying yourself.
所谓、涅槃心易晓、差别智难明。
It is easy to know the Nirvana mind but difficult to attain the wisdom of
differentiation.
晓: xiǎo, dawn, to know (HSK6). Here means to understand. (Alternative: 明白, 了解)
明得差别智、家国自安宁。
When you have realized this wisdom, peace and order will reign over your land.
