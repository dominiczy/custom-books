## The Gateless Gate 无门关
Wu-wen kuan (Mumonkan)

## Mumon's Preface

佛语心为宗、无门为法门。
Buddhism makes mind its foundation and no-gate its gate.

既是无门、且作么生透。
Now, how do you pass through this no-gate?

岂不见道、从门入者不是家珍、从缘得者始终成坏。
It is said that things coming in through the gate can never be your own treasures.
What is gained from external circumstances will perish in the end.

恁么说话、大似无风起浪好肉抉疮。
Non-HSK Characters Found:
*   **恁** (nèn) - (dialect) so, such, in that way. Alternative: 那么 (nàme), 这样 (zhèyàng) (HSK1, HSK3)

However, such a saying is already raising waves when there is no wind. It is
cutting unblemished skin.

As for those who try to understand through other people's words, they are striking
at the moon with a stick; scratching a shoe, whereas it is the foot that itches. What
concern have they with the truth?

In the summer of the first year of Jõtei, Ekai was in Ryûshõ Temple and as head
monk worked with the monks, using the cases of the ancient masters as brickbats
to batter the gate and lead them on according to their respective capacities.

纵使西天四七、东土二三、只得望风乞命。

lives.

If you do not pass the barrier, and do not cut off the way of thinking, then you will
be like a ghost clinging to the bushes and weeds.

且道、如何是祖师关。
Now, I want to ask you, what is the barrier of the patriarchs?

Non-HSK Characters Found:
*   **箇** (gè) - (dialect) this; (same as 个). Alternative: 个 (gè) (HSK1)

seeing with the same eyes, hearing with the same ears.

岂不庆快。
Isn't that a delightful prospect?

莫有要透关底么。

spontaneously united. You will know this, but for yourself only, like a dumb man
who has had a dream.

patriarchs, you kill them. On the brink of life and death, you command perfect

freedom; among the sixfold worlds and four modes of existence, you enjoy a merry
and playful samadhi.

且作么生提撕。
Now, I want to ask you again, "How will you carry it out?"

百丈野狐
Case 2 Hyakujõ's Fox

百丈和尚、凡参次、有一老人常随众听法。
When Hyakujõ Oshõ delivered a certain series of sermons, an old man always
followed the monks to the main hall and listened to him.

众人退、老人亦退。
When the monks left the hall, the old man would also leave.

忽一日不退。师遂问、面前立者复是何人。
One day, however, he remained behind, and Hyakujõ asked him, "Who are you,
standing here before me?"

因学人问、大修行底人还落因果也无。
One day a student asked me, 'Does a man of enlightenment fall under the yoke of
causation or not?'

某甲对云、不落因果。
I answered, 'No, he does not.'

Since then I have been doomed to undergo five hundred rebirths as a fox.

I beg you now to give the turning word to release me from my life as a fox.

作礼云、某甲、已脱野狐身住在山后。
Making his bows, he said, "I am emancipated from my life as a fox. I shall remain
on this mountain.

sick ward. What does this mean?"

食后只见师领众至山后岩下、以杖挑出一死野狐、乃依火葬。
After the meal Hyakujõ led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the
mountain and with his staff poked out the dead body of a fox and performed the
ceremony of cremation.

师、至晚上堂、举前因缘。
That evening he ascended the rostrum and told the monks the whole story.

himself."

明遂举之如山不动、踟蹰悚栗。明白、我来求法、非为衣也。

山云、某甲从今日去不疑天下老和尚舌头也。
"From now on," said Tokusan, "I will not doubt the words of an old oshõ who is renowned everywhere under the sun."
至明日、龙潭升堂云、可中有个汉、牙如剑树、口似血盆。
The next day Ryûtan ascended the rostrum and said, "I see a fellow among you. His fangs are like the sword tree. His mouth is like a blood bowl.
一棒打不回头。
Strike him with a stick, and he won't turn his head to look at you.
他时异日、向孤峰顶上立君道在。
Someday or other, he will climb the highest of the peaks and establish our Way there."
山遂取疏抄于法堂前、将一炬火提起云、穷诸玄辨、若一毫致于太虚、竭世枢机似一滴投于巨壑。
Tokusan brought his notes on the Diamond Sutra to the front of the hall, pointed to them with a torch, and said, "Even though you have exhausted the abstruse doctrines, it is like placing a hair in a great space.

Before Tokusan crossed the barrier from his native place, his mind burned and his mouth uttered bitterness. He went southward, intending to stamp out the doctrines of special transmission outside the sutras.

When he reached the road to Reishû, he asked an old woman to let him have lunch to "refresh the mind."
婆云、大德车子内是什么文字。
"Your worship, what sort of literature do you carry in your pack?" the old woman asked.
山云、金刚经疏抄。
"Commentaries on the Diamond Sutra," replied Tokusan.

婆云、只如经中道、过去心不可得、现在心不可得、未来心不可得。
The old woman said, "I hear it is said in that sutra, 'The past mind cannot be held, the present mind cannot be held, the future mind cannot be held.'

婆云、五里外有龙潭和尚。
The old woman said, "Five miles from here you will find Ryûtan Oshõ."
及到龙潭纳尽败阙。
Coming to Ryûtan, Tokusan got the worst of it.
可谓是前言不应后语。
His former words were inconsistent with his later ones.
龙潭大似怜儿不觉丑。
As for Ryûtan, he seemed to have lost all sense of shame in his compassion toward his son.
见他有些子火种、郎忙将恶水蓦头一浇浇杀。
Finding a bit of live coal in the other, enough to start a fire, he hurriedly poured on muddy water to annihilate everything at once.
冷地看来、一场好笑。
A little cool reflection tells us it was a farce.

Mumon's Verse 颂曰
闻名不如见面 Hearing the name cannot surpass seeing the face;
见面不如闻名 Seeing the face cannot surpass hearing the name.
虽然救得鼻孔 He may have saved his nose,
争奈瞎却眼睛 But alas! he lost his eyes.

If you directly grasp Baso's meaning, you wear the Buddha's clothes, eat the Buddha's food, speak the Buddha's words, do the Buddha's deeds—that is, you are a Buddha himself.

However, alas! Daibai misled not a few people into taking the mark on the balance for the weight itself.

In such a case, if you can manage an intimate meeting with him it will certainly be gratifying.
其或未然、也须一切处着眼。
But if you cannot, you must be watchful in every way.

If you make a complete about-face, open your eye, and give a turning word on this point, you will be able to repay the four kinds of love that have favored you and help the sentient beings in the three realms who follow you.
其或未然、更须照顾尾巴始得。
If you are still unable to do this, return to this tail and reflect upon it, and then for the first time you will realize something.

Mumon's Verse 颂曰
过去堕抗 Passing by, it falls into a ditch;

Mumon's Comment
无门曰、若向者里见得云门用处孤危、者僧因甚话堕、堪与人天为师。
If you clearly understand this and realize how exacting Unmon was in his method, and what made the monk err in his speaking, you are qualified to be a teacher of heaven and earth.

Mumon's Comment
无门日、山一期之勇、争奈跳百丈圈不出、点将来、便重不便轻。
Isan displayed great spirit in his action, but he could not cut himself free from Hyakujõ's apron strings. He preferred the heavier task to lighter one.

世尊、昔、因文殊、至诸佛集处值诸佛各还本处。
Once, in the old days, in the time of the World-honored One, Manjusri went to the assembly of the Buddhas and found that everyone had departed to his original dwelling place.
惟有一女人近彼佛坐入于三昧。
Only a girl remained, sitting in samadhi close to the Buddha's throne.
文殊乃白佛、云何女人得近佛坐而我不得。
Manjusri asked Shakyamuni Buddha, "Why can the girl get near the Buddha's throne, while I cannot?"
佛告文殊、汝但觉此女、令从三昧起、汝自问之。
Shakyamuni Buddha said, "Bring her out of her samadhi and ask her yourself."
文殊绕女人三口、鸣指一下、乃托至梵天尽其神力而不能出。
Manjusri walked around the girl three times, snapped his fingers once, took her to the Brahma heaven, and exerted all his miraculous powers to bring her out of her meditation, but in vain.
世尊云、假使百千文殊亦出此女人定不得。
The World-honored One said, "Even a hundred thousand Manjusris cannot make her wake up.

下方过一十二亿河沙国土有冈明菩萨。
But down below, past twelve hundred million lands as innumerable as the sands of Ganges, there is a Bodhisattva Mõmyõ.
能出此女人定。
He will be able to rouse her from her samadhi."
须臾罔明大士、从地涌出礼拜世尊。世尊敕罔明。
Instantly the Bodhisattva Mõmyõ emerged from the earth and made a bow to the World-honored One, who gave him his imperial order.
却至女人前鸣指一下。
The Bodhisattva went over to the girl and snapped his fingers once.
女人于是从定而出。
At this she came out of her samadhi.

Mumon's Comment
无门曰、释迦老子、做者一场杂剧、不通小小。
Old Shakyamuni put a petty drama on the stage and failed to enlighten the masses.
且道、文殊是七佛之师、因甚出女人定不得。
I want to ask you: Manjusri is the teacher of the Seven Buddhas; why couldn't he arouse the girl from her samadhi?
罔明初地菩萨、为甚却出得。
How was it that Mõmyõ, a Bodhisattva at the beginner's stage, could do it?
若向者里见得亲切、业识忙忙那伽大定。
If you understand this intimately, you will enjoy Nagya's grand samadhi in the busiest activity of consciousness.

无门曰、若也见得他分晓、譬如十字街头撞见亲爷相似、更不须问别人道是与不是。
If you can really see this "another" with perfect clarity, it is like encountering your own father at a crossroads. Why should you ask whether you recognize him or not?

The Gateless Gate 无门关
Wu-wen kuan (Mumonkan)

Mumon's Preface
佛语心为宗、无门为法门。
Buddhism makes mind its foundation and no-gate its gate.
既是无门、且作么生透。
Now, how do you pass through this no-gate?
岂不见道、从门入者不是家珍、从缘得者始终成坏。
It is said that things coming in through the gate can never be your own treasures.
What is gained from external circumstances will perish in the end.
恁么说话、大似无风起浪好肉抉疮。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 恁 (nín): this, that; such. Alternative: 那么 (nàme).
- 抉 (jué): to dig out; to gouge out. Alternative: 挖 (wā), 挑 (tiǎo).
- 疮 (chuāng): sore; ulcer; wound. Alternative: 伤口 (shāngkǒu).
However, such a saying is already raising waves when there is no wind. It is
cutting unblemished skin.
何况滞言句觅解会。掉棒打月、隔靴爬痒、有甚交涉。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 滞 (zhì): stagnant; sluggish; blocked. Alternative: 阻碍 (zǔ'ài), 停滞 (tíngzhì).
As for those who try to understand through other people's words, they are striking
at the moon with a stick; scratching a shoe, whereas it is the foot that itches. What
concern have they with the truth?

慧开、绍定戊子夏、首众于东嘉龙翔。因纳子请益、遂将古人公案作敲门瓦子、随机引导学者。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 戊 (wù): the fifth of the ten Heavenly Stems (used in traditional calendrical cycles). No direct HSK alternative for this specific calendrical meaning.
In the summer of the first year of Jõtei, Ekai was in Ryûshõ Temple and as head
monk worked with the monks, using the cases of the ancient masters as brickbats
to batter the gate and lead them on according to their respective capacities.
竟尔抄录、不觉成集。初不以前后叙列、共成四十八则。
The text was written down not according to any scheme, but just to make a
collection of forty-eight cases.

若是箇汉、不顾危亡单刀直入。

八臂那咤、搁他不在。

Then even the eight-armed Nata cannot hinder him.
纵使西天四七、东土二三、只得望风乞命。
Even the four sevens of the West and the two threes of the East would beg for their
lives.
设或踌躇、也似隔窗看马骑、贬得眼来、早已蹉过。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 蹉 (cuō): to err; to make a mistake; to pass by; to miss. Alternative: 错过 (cuòguò).
If one has no determination, then it will be like catching a glimpse of a horse
galloping past the window: in the twinkling of an eye it will be gone.

百丈野狐
Case 2 Hyakujõ's Fox
百丈和尚、凡参次、有一老人常随众听法。
When Hyakujõ Oshõ delivered a certain series of sermons, an old man always
followed the monks to the main hall and listened to him.
众人退、老人亦退。
When the monks left the hall, the old man would also leave.
忽一日不退。师遂问、面前立者复是何人。
One day, however, he remained behind, and Hyakujõ asked him, "Who are you,
standing here before me?"
老人云、诺。
The old man replied.
某甲非人也。
"I am not a human being.
于过去迦叶佛时曾住此山。
In the old days of Kashyapa Buddha, I was a head monk, living here on this
mountain.
因学人问、大修行底人还落因果也无。
One day a student asked me, 'Does a man of enlightenment fall under the yoke of
causation or not?'
某甲对云、不落因果。
I answered, 'No, he does not.'
五百生堕野狐身。

Since then I have been doomed to undergo five hundred rebirths as a fox.
今请、和尚代一转语贵脱野狐。
I beg you now to give the turning word to release me from my life as a fox.
遂问、大修行底人、还落因果也无。
Tell me, does a man of enlightenment fall under the yoke of causation or not?"
师云、不昧因果。
Hyakujõ answered, "He does not ignore causation."
老人于言下大悟。
No sooner had the old man heard these words than he was enlightened.
作礼云、某甲、已脱野狐身住在山后。
Making his bows, he said, "I am emancipated from my life as a fox. I shall remain
on this mountain.
敢告和尚。乞、依亡僧事例。
I have a favor to ask of you: would you please bury my body as that of a dead

Hyakujõ had the director of the monks strike with the gavel and inform everyone
that after the midday meal there would be a funeral service for a dead monk.

The monks wondered at this, saying, "Everyone is in good health; nobody is in the
sick ward. What does this mean?"

Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 嵒 (yán): cliff; precipice. Alternative: 崖 (yá), 峭壁 (qiàobì). (Note: `岩` is HSK6 and could be an alternative.)

mountain and with his staff poked out the dead body of a fox and performed the
ceremony of cremation.
师、至晚上堂、举前因缘。
That evening he ascended the rostrum and told the monks the whole story.

answer, what would have happened then?"
师云、近前来与伊道。
Hyakujõ said, "You come here to me, and I will tell you."

Hyakujõ clapped his hands with a laugh and exclaimed, "I was thinking that the
barbarian had a red beard, but now I see before me the red-bearded barbarian
himself."

If you say it cannot be transmitted, then why did the Buddha approve of
Mahakashyapa?
Mumon's Verse 颂曰

rung, and the drum has not sounded." Tokusan turned and went back to his room.

Mumon's Comment
无门曰、若是未后句、岩头德山俱未梦见在。

无门曰、云门、当时便与本分草料、使洞山别有生机一路、家门不致寂寥。
If Unmon had given Tozan the true food of Zen and encouraged him to develop an
active Zen spirit, his school would not have declined as it did.
一夜在是非海里著到、直待天明再来、又与他注破。
Tõzan had an agonizing struggle through the whole night, lost in the sea of right
and wrong. He reached a complete impasse. After waiting for the dawn, he again
went to Unmon, and Unmon again made him a picture book of Zen.

Don't you know that the real Zen student commands sounds, controls forms, is
clear-sighted at every event and free on every occasion?
然虽如是。且道、声来耳畔、耳往声边。
Granted you are free, just tell me: Does the sound come to the ear or does the ear
go to the sound?
直饶响寂双忘、到此如何话会。
If both sound and silence die away, at such a juncture how could you talk of Zen?
若将耳听应难会、眼处闻声方始亲。
While listening with you ear, you cannot tell. When hearing with your eye, you are
truly intimate.

- 识 (shí): to know; to recognize. Alternative: 认识 (rènshi). (Note: `认识` is HSK1, `识` by itself is HSK1. This might be a mistake in my HSK character parsing logic for individual vs compound). Re-checking: `识` (shí) is HSK1. So it IS HSK. No non-HSK for this line.
Why, Shasanro did not know for ideographs.

Case 42 The Girl Comes out of Samadhi
四十二女子出定
世尊、昔、因文殊、至诸佛集处值诸佛各还本处。
Once, in the old days, in the time of the World-honored One, Manjusri went to the
assembly of the Buddhas and found that everyone had departed to his original
dwelling place.
惟有一女人近彼佛坐入于三昧。
Only a girl remained, sitting in samadhi close to the Buddha's throne.
文殊乃白佛、云何女人得近佛坐而我不得。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 乃 (nǎi): is; be; then; thereupon. Alternative: 是 (shì), 于是 (yúshì).
Manjusri asked Shakyamuni Buddha, "Why can the girl get near the Buddha's
throne, while I cannot?"
佛告文殊、汝但觉此女、令从三昧起、汝自问之。
Shakyamuni Buddha said, "Bring her out of her samadhi and ask her yourself."
文殊遶女人三口、鸣指一下、乃托至梵天尽其神力而不能出。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 遶 (rào): Traditional variant of 绕 (rào). Alternative: 绕 (rào).

Manjusri walked around the girl three times, snapped his fingers once, took her to
the Brahma heaven, and exerted all his miraculous powers to bring her out of her
meditation, but in vain.
世尊云、假使百千文殊亦出此女人定不得。

The World-honored One said, "Even a hundred thousand Manjusris cannot make
her wake up.
下方过一十二亿河沙国土有冈明菩萨。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 冈 (gāng): hillock; mound. Alternative: 小山 (xiǎoshān).
But down below, past twelve hundred million lands as innumerable as the sands of
Ganges, there is a Bodhisattva Mõmyõ.
能出此女人定。
He will be able to rouse her from her samadhi."
须臾罔明大士、从地涌出礼拜世尊。世尊敕罔明。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 罔 (wǎng): net; to deceive; none. Alternative: 网 (wǎng), 无 (wú).
- 敕 (chì): imperial order. Alternative: 命令 (mìnglìng).
Instantly the Bodhisattva Mõmyõ emerged from the earth and made a bow to the
World-honored One, who gave him his imperial order.
却至女人前鸣指一下。
The Bodhisattva went over to the girl and snapped his fingers once.
女人于是从定而出。
At this she came out of her samadhi.
Mumon's Comment
无门曰、释迦老子、做者一场杂剧、不通小小。
Old Shakyamuni put a petty drama on the stage and failed to enlighten the masses.
且道、文殊是七佛之师、因甚出女人定不得。
I want to ask you: Manjusri is the teacher of the Seven Buddhas; why couldn't he
arouse the girl from her samadhi?
罔明初地菩萨、为甚却出得。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 罔 (wǎng): net; to deceive; none. Alternative: 网 (wǎng), 无 (wú).

- 伽 (gā): (phonetic character); monastery. Used here in `那伽` (nājiā), Nāga. No HSK alternative for this specific term.

busiest activity of consciousness.

渠侬得自由 Both secured freedom of mind.
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 侬 (nóng): I; you (used in Wu dialect); (archaic) he/she. Alternative: 你 (nǐ), 他 (tā).

Bashō Osho said to his disciples, "If you have a staff, I will give you a staff.
无杖子、我夺杖子。
If you have no staff, I will take it from you."
Mumon's Comment

It helps me wade across a river when the bridge is down. It accompanies me to the
village on a moonless night.

If you call it a staff, you will enter hell like an arrow.

诸方深与浅
The depths and shallows of the world

Are all in its grasp.

Hõen of Tozan said, "Even Shakya and Maitreya are servants of another.
且道、他是阿谁。
I want to ask you, who is he?"
Mumon's Comment
无门曰、若也见得他分晓、譬如十字街头撞见亲爷相似、更不须问别人道是与不是。
If you can really see this "another" with perfect clarity, it is like encountering your
own father at a crossroads. Why should you ask whether you recognize him or not?

石霜和尚云、百尺竿头、如何进步。
Sekisõ Oshõ asked, "How can you proceed on further from the top of a hundred-
foot pole?"
又古德云、百尺竿头坐底人、虽然得入未为真。
Another eminent teacher of old said, "You, who sit on the top of a hundred-foot
pole, although you have entered the Way you are not yet genuine.
百尺竿头、须进步十方世界现全身。
Proceed on from the top of the pole, and you will show your whole body in the ten
directions."
Mumon's Comment
无门曰、进步、翻得身、更嫌何处不称尊。
If you go on further and turn your body about, no place is left where you are not
the master.
然虽如是、且道、百尺竿头、如何进步。
Ο
But even so, tell me, how will you go on further from the top of a hundred-foot
pole? Eh?"
Mumon's Verse 颂曰
瞎却顶门眼 He darkens the third eye of insight

错认定盘星 And clings to the first mark on the scale.
拌身能舍命 Even though he may sacrifice his life,
一盲引众盲 He is only a blind man leading the blind.
Case 47 Tosotsu's Three Barriers
兜率悦和尚、设三关问学者、
Tosotsu Etsu Oshõ set up three barriers for his disciples:
拨草参玄只图见性。
四十七兜率三关
1. You leave no stone unturned to explore profundity, simply to see into your true
nature.
即今上人性在甚处。
Now, I want to ask you, just at this moment, where is your true nature?
识得自性方脱生死。
2. If you realize your true nature, you are free from life and death.
眼光落时、作么生脱。
Tell me, when your eyesight deserts you at the last moment, how can you be free
from life and death?
脱得生死便知去处、四大分离向甚处去。
3. When you set yourself free from life and death, you should know your ultimate
destination. So when the four elements separate, where will you go?
Mumon's Comment
无门曰、若能下得此三转语、便可以随处作主遇缘即宗。
If you can put turning words to these three questions, you are the master wherever
you may stand and command Zen whatever circumstances you may be in.

well can sustain you.

无量劫事即如今
Eternal time is just this moment.

If you see through this moment's thought,
□破如今底人 You see through the man who sees through this moment.

I still wonder where the road can be."
峰拈起杖、划一划云、在者里。
Kempõ lifted his staff, drew a line, and said, "Here it is."
后僧请益云门。
Later the monks asked the same question to Unmon,

Before the tongue is moved, the speech is finished.
直饶著著在机先

There is no gate for you to go through; there are no stairs for you to ascend.
掉臂度关不问关吏。
You pass the checkpoint, squaring your shoulders, without asking permission of the
keeper.
岂不见玄沙道、无门解脱之门、无意道人之意。

The Gateless Gate 无门关
Wu-wen kuan (Mumonkan)

Mumon's Preface
佛语心为宗、无门为法门。
Buddhism makes mind its foundation and no-gate its gate.
既是无门、且作么生透。
Now, how do you pass through this no-gate?
岂不见道、从门入者不是家珍、从缘得者始终成坏。
It is said that things coming in through the gate can never be your own treasures.
What is gained from external circumstances will perish in the end.
恁么说话、大似无风起浪好肉抉疮。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 恁 (nèn/rèn): (archaic/dialectal) that; so; what. Alternative: 这样 (zhèyàng), 那么 (nàme).
- 抉 (jué): to dig out; to pick out; to gouge. Alternative: 挖出 (wāchū), 挑出 (tiāochū).
- 疮 (chuāng): sore; ulcer; wound. Alternative: 伤口 (shāngkǒu), 伤疤 (shāngbā).
However, such a saying is already raising waves when there is no wind. It is
cutting unblemished skin.
何况滞言句觅解会。掉棒打月、隔靴爬痒、有甚交涉。
Non-HSK Characters in the line above:
- 滞 (zhì): stagnant; blocked; to hinder. Alternative: 停滞 (tíngzhì), 阻碍 (zǔ'ài).
- 觅 (mì): to seek; to look for. Alternative: 寻找 (xúnzhǎo), 寻求 (xúnqiú).
As for those who try to understand through other people's words, they are striking
at the moon with a stick; scratching a shoe, whereas it is the foot that itches. What
concern have they with the truth?
