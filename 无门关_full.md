- 门 (mén): gate, door (替代: 门口 (ménkǒu))
既是无门、且作么生透。
Now, how do you pass through this no-gate?
岂不见道、从门入者不是家珍、从缘得者始终成坏。
It is said that things coming in through the gate can never be your own treasures.
What is gained from external circumstances will perish in the end.
恁么说话、大似无风起浪好肉抉疮。
However, such a saying is already raising waves when there is no wind. It is

何况滞言句觅解会。 掉棒打月、隔靴爬痒、有甚交涉。
As for those who try to understand through other people's words, they are striking
at the moon with a stick; scratching a shoe, whereas it is the foot that itches. What

Why, it is this single word "Mu." That is the front gate to Zen.
遂目之曰禅宗无门关。
Therefore it is called the "Mumonkan of Zen."
透得过者、非但亲见赵州、便可与历代祖师把手共行、眉毛厮结同一眼见、
同一耳闻。
If you pass through it, you will not only see Jõshû face to face, but you will also go

道四生中游戏三昧。

hold it in your hand. When you meet the Buddha, you kill him; when you meet the

说亲见、早成两个。
But saying you are really intimate with him already divides you into two.

Why don't you retire?"
山遂珍重揭帘而出。见外面黑却回云、外面黑。
Tokusan made his bows and lifted the blinds to withdraw, but he was met by darkness. Turning back to Ryûtan, he said, "It is dark outside."

潭云、子见个什么道理。
Ryûtan said, "What sort of realization do you have?"
山云、某甲从今日去不疑天下老和尚舌头也。
"From now on," said Tokusan, "I will not doubt the words of an old oshõ who is
renowned everywhere under the sun."
至明日、龙潭升堂云、可中有个汉、牙如剑树、口似血盆。
The next day Ryûtan ascended the rostrum and said, "I see a fellow among you.
His fangs are like the sword tree. His mouth is like a blood bowl.
一棒打不回头。
Strike him with a stick, and he won't turn his head to look at you.
他时异日、向孤峰顶上立君道在。
Someday or other, he will climb the highest of the peaks and establish our Way
there."
山遂取疏抄于法堂前、将一炬火提起云、穷诸玄辨、若一毫致于太虚、竭世
枢机似一滴投于巨壑。
Tokusan brought his notes on the Diamond Sutra to the front of the hall, pointed to
them with a torch, and said, "Even though you have exhausted the abtruse
doctrines, it is like placing a hair in a vast space. Even though you have learned all
the secrets of the world, it is like a drop of water dripped on the great ocean."
将疏抄便烧。
And he burned all his notes.
于是礼辞。
Then, making bows, he took his leave of his teacher.

special transmission outside the sutras.
及到
州路上问婆子买点心。
When he reached the road to Reishû, he asked an old woman to let him have lunch
to "refresh the mind."
婆云、大德车子内是什麽文字。
"Your worship, what sort of literature do you carry in your pack?" the old woman
asked.
山云、金刚经疏抄。
"Commentaries on the Diamond Sutra," replied Tokusan.
婆云、只如经中道、过去心不可得、见在心不可得、未来心不可得。
The old woman said, "I hear it is said in that sutra, 'The past mind cannot be held,
the present mind cannot be held, the future mind cannot be held.'
大德、要点那个心。
Now, I would like to ask you, what mind are you going to have refreshed?"
德山被者一问、直得口似□檐。
At this question Tokusan was dumbfounded.
然虽如是、未肯向婆子句下死却。遂问婆子、近处有什麽宗师。
However, he did not remain inert under her words but asked, "Do you know of any
good teacher around here?"
婆云、五里外有龙潭和尚。
The old woman said, "Five miles from here you will find Ryûtan Oshõ."
及到龙潭纳尽败阙。
Coming to Ryûtan, Tokusan got the worst of it.
可谓是前言不应后语。
His former words were inconsistent with his later ones.
龙潭大似怜儿不觉丑。
As for Ryûtan, he seemed to have lost all sense of shame in his compassion toward
his son.
见他有些子火种、郎忙将恶水蓦头一浇浇杀。
Finding a bit of live coal in the other, enough to start a fire, he hurriedly poured on
muddy water to annihilate everything at once.
冷地看来、一场好笑。

gold when buying iron.

However, alas! Daibai misled not a few people into taking the mark on the balance
for the weight itself.
争知道说个佛字、三日漱口。
How could he realize that even mentioning the word "Buddha" should make us
rinse out our mouths for three days?
若是箇汉、见说即心是佛、掩耳便走。
If a man of understanding hears anyone say, "This very mind is the Buddha," he
will cover his ears and rush away.

Jõshû said, "Wait a bit, I will go and investigate the old woman for you."
明日便去亦如是问。 婆亦如是答。
The next day he went and asked the same question, and the old woman gave the
same answer.
州归谓众曰、台山婆子、我与□勘破了也。
On returning, Jõshû said to his disciples, "I have investigated the old woman of
Taisan for you."

### Mumon's Comment

无门曰、婆子只解坐筹帷幄、要且著贼不知。
The old woman only knew how to sit still in her tent and plan the campaign; she
did not know when she was shadowed by a spy.
赵州老人、善用偷营劫塞乃机、又且无大人相。
Though old Jõshû showed himself clever enough to take a camp and overwhelm a
fortress, he displayed no trace of being a great commander.
点将来、二俱有过。
If we look at them, they both have their faults.
且道、那里是赵州、勘破婆子处。
But tell me, what did Jõshû see in the old woman?

### Mumon's Verse 颂曰

问既一般
The question was like the others,
答亦相似
The answer was the same.
饭里有砂
Sand in the rice,
泥中有刺
Thorns in the mud.

Then Ananda asked the Buddha, "What did he realize, to admire you so much?"
世尊云、如世良马见鞭影而行。
The World-honored One replied, "A fine horse runs even at the shadow of the
whip."

### Mumon's Comment

无门曰、阿难乃佛弟子、宛不如外道见解、且道、外道与佛弟子相去多少。
Ananda was the Buddha's disciple, but his understanding was not equal to that of
the non-Buddhist. I want to ask you, what difference is there between the Buddha's
disciple and the non-Buddhist?

dwelling place.

惟有一女人近彼佛坐入于三昧。
Only a girl remained, sitting in samadhi close to the Buddha's throne.

文殊乃白佛、云何女人得近佛坐而我不得。
Manjusri asked Shakyamuni Buddha, "Why can the girl get near the Buddha's
throne, while I cannot?"

佛告文殊、汝但觉此女、令从三昧起、汝自问之。
Shakyamuni Buddha said, "Bring her out of her samadhi and ask her yourself."

文殊绕女人三匝、鸣指一下、乃托至梵天尽其神力而不能出。

the Brahma heaven, and exerted all his miraculous powers to bring her out of her
meditation, but in vain.
匝 (zā): to go around, circumference (Alternative: 绕 (rào), 圈 (quān))

世尊云、假使百千文殊亦出此女人定不得。

But down below, past twelve hundred million lands as innumerable as the sands of

I want to ask you: Manjusri is the teacher of the Seven Buddhas; why couldn't he
arouse the girl from her samadhi?

罔明初地菩萨、为甚却出得。
How was it that Mõmyõ, a Bodhisattva at the beginner's stage, could do it?

nature.

即今上人性在甚处。

from life and death?

Nothing superfluous has been added by the author, who has taken the lid off his
head and exposed his eyeballs.

肯要诸人直下承当、不从他觅。
Your direct realization is demanded; it should not be sought through others.

若是通方上士。 才闻举著、便知落处。
If you are a man of realization, you will immediately grasp the point at the slightest
mention of it.

differentiation.

明得差别智、家国自安宁。
When you have realized this wisdom, peace and order will reign over your land.
